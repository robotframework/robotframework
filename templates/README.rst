Templates
=========

This directory contains templates that can be used when creating test
data for Robot Framework. These templates can be edited using normal
HTML or TSV editors and they can be costomized freely. 
See `Robot Framework User Guide`__ for more information about how 
different tables are recognized and the test data syntax in general.

* testcase_template.html, testcase_template.tsv
    Templates for creating test cases in HTML and TSV formats, respectively.

* resource_template.html, resource_template.tsv
    HTML and TSV templates for creating resource files. Same templates
    can be used also to create test suite initialization files.

* atdd_template.html
    Template for creating test cases in Acceptance Test-Driven
    Development (ATDD) style. These use-case-like test cases are
    created from high-level keywords needing no arguments, and the
    template has been simplified accordingly.
