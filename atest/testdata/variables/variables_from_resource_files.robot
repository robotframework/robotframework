*** Test Case ***
Scalar String
    Should Be Equal    ${STRING}    Hello world!
    Should Be Equal    I said: "${STRING}"    I said: "Hello world!"

Scalar Non-Strings
    Should Be True    ${INTEGER} == 42
    Should Be True    ${FLOAT} == -1.2
    Should Be True    ${BOOLEAN} == True
    Should Be True    ${NONE VALUE} == None

Scalar String With Escapes
    Should Be Equal    ${ESCAPES}    one \\ two \\\\ \${non_existing}

Empty Scalar String
    Should Be Equal    ${NO VALUE}    ${EMPTY}
    Should Be Equal    "${NO VALUE}${NO VALUE}"    ""

Scalar List
    Should Not Be Equal    ${LIST}    Hello world !
    Should Be True    ${LIST} == ['Hello','again', '?']
    Should Be Equal    ${LIST[0]}    Hello
    Should Be Equal    ${LIST[1]}    again
    Should Be Equal    ${LIST[2]}    ?

Scalar List With Non-Strings
    Should Be True    ${LIST WITH NON STRINGS} == [42, -1.2, True, None]

Scalar List With Escapes
    Test List With Escapes
    ...    ${LIST WITH ESCAPES [0]}    ${LIST WITH ESCAPES [1]}
    ...    ${LIST WITH ESCAPES [2]}    ${LIST WITH ESCAPES [3]}
    ${exp} =    Create List    one \\    two \\\\    three \\\\\\    \${non_existing}

    Should Be True    ${LIST WITH ESCAPES} == ['one \\\\', 'two \\\\\\\\', 'three \\\\\\\\\\\\', '\${non_existing}']    Backslashes are doubled here because 'Should Be True' uses 'eval' internally

List with One Item
    Should Be True    ${ONE ITEM} == ['Hello again?']
    Should Be Equal    ${ONE ITEM}[0]    Hello again?

List With Multiple Items
    Should Be Equal    ${LIST}[0]    Hello
    Should Be Equal    ${LIST}[1]    again

    Should Be True    ${EMPTY LIST} == []
    ${ret} =    Catenate    @{EMPTY LIST}    @{EMPTY LIST}    only value    @{EMPTY LIST}
    Should Be Equal    ${ret}    only value
