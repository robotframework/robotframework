Matcher type cannot be defined with variable

Skip cannot be caught

    TRY
        SKIP   hello!
    EXCEPT
        No operation
    FINALLY
        No operation
    END

Return cannot be caught
    ${value}=    Uk with return
    Should be equal    ${value}    value

AS gets the message
    TRY
        Fail    failure
    EXCEPT    failure    AS    ${err}

AS with many failures
    TRY
        Run keyword and continue on failure    Fail    oh no!
        Fail    fail again!
    EXCEPT    GLOB: Several*    AS   ${err}
        Should be equal    ${err}    Several failures occurred:\n\n1) oh no!\n\n2) fail again!
    END

AS with default except
    TRY
        Fail    failure
    EXCEPT    AS    ${err}
        Should be equal    ${err}    failure

AS as the error message
    TRY
