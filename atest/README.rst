Robot Framework acceptance tests
================================

Introduction
------------

Acceptance tests for Robot Framework are naturally created using Robot
Framework itself. This folder contains all those acceptance tests and other
test data they need.

Directory contents
------------------

run.py
    A script for running acceptance tests. See below for further instructions.

genrunner.py
    Script to generate atest runners based on plain text data files.

    Usage:  genrunner.py testdata/path/data.robot [robot/path/runner.robot]

robot/
    Contains actual acceptance test cases. See `Test data`_ section for details.

resources/
    Resources needed by acceptance tests in the ``robot`` folder.

testdata/
    Contains test cases that are run by actual acceptance tests in the
    ``robot`` folder. See `Test data`_ section for details.

testresources/
    Contains resources needed by test cases in the ``testdata`` folder.
    Some of these resources are also used by unit tests.

results/
    The place for test execution results. This directory is generated when
    acceptance tests are executed. It is in ``.gitignore`` and can be safely
    deleted any time.

Running acceptance tests
------------------------

Robot Framework's acceptance tests are run using `<run.py>`__. See its
documentation our run it with ``--help`` to see the usage. To run all the
acceptance tests, execute the ``atest/robot`` folder entirely::

    python atest/run.py python atest/robot

The command above will execute all tests, but often you may want to skip
for example `telnet tests`_ and tests requiring manual interaction. These
tests are marked with the ``no-ci`` tag and can be excluded from the test run::

    python atest/run.py python --exclude no-ci atest/robot

A sub test suite can be executed simply by running the folder or file
containing it. On modern machines running all acceptance tests ought to
take less than ten minutes with Python, but with Jython the execution time
is considerably longer. This is due to Jython being somewhat slower than
Python in general, but the main reason is that the JVM is started by
acceptance dozens of times and it always takes few seconds.

Before a release tests should be executed separately using  Python, Jython, and
IronPython to verify interoperability with all supported interpreters. Tests
should also be run using different interpreter versions (when applicable) and
on different operating systems.

The results of the test execution are written into an interpreter specific
directory under the ``atest/results`` directory. Temporary outputs created
during the execution are created under the system temporary directory.

Test data
---------

The test data is divided to two, test data part (``atest/testdata`` folder) and
running part (``atest/robot`` folder). Test data side contains test cases for
different features. Running side contains the actual acceptance test cases
that run the test cases on the test data side and verify their results.

The basic mechanism to verify that a test case in the test data side is
executed as expected is setting the expected status and possible error
message in its documentation. By default tests are expected to pass, but
having ``FAIL`` (this and subsequent markers are case sensitive) in the
documentation changes the expectation. The text after the ``FAIL`` marker
is the expected error message, which, by default, must match the actual
error exactly. If the error message starts with ``REGEXP:``, ``GLOB:`` or
``STARTS:``, the expected error is considered to be a regexp or glob pattern
matching the actual error, or to contain the beginning of the error. All
other details can be tested also, but that logic is in the running side.

Test tags
---------

The tests on the running side (``atest/robot``) contains tags that are used
to include or exclude them based on the platform and required dependencies.
Selecting tests based on the platform is done automatically by the `<run.py>`__
script, but additional selection can be done by the user to avoid running
tests that require dependencies that are not available.

manual
  Require manual interaction from user. Used with Dialogs library tests.

telnet
  Require a telnet server with test account running at localhost. See
  `Telnet tests`_ for details.

no-ci
  Tests which are not executed at continuous integration. Contains all tests
  tagged with ``manual`` or ``telnet``.

require-jython
  Require the interpreter to be Jython. Mainly used with tests related to
  Java integration.

require-windows
  Require the operating system to be Windows.

require-yaml, require-docutils, require-lxml, require-screenshot
  Require lxml, docutils, PyYAML, or platform specific screenshot module to
  be installed, respectively. See `Required modules`_ for details.

require-et13
  Require ElementTree version 1.3. Automatically excluded when running with
  Python 2.6 or IronPython.

require-tools.jar
  Require the tools.jar from JVM to be in ``CLASSPATH`` environment variable.
  This is only needed on some Libdoc tests on Jython.

no-windows, no-osx, no-jython, no-ipy,  ...
  Tests to be excluded on different operating systems or Python interpreter
  versions. Excluded automatically.

Examples:

.. code:: bash

    # Exclude tests requiring manual interaction or running telnet server.
    python atest/run.py python --exclude no-ci atest/robot

    # Same as the above but also exclude tests requiring docutils and lxml
    python atest/run.py python -e no-ci -e require-docutils -e require-lxml atest/robot

    # Run only tests related to Java integration. This is considerably faster
    # than running all tests on Jython.
    python atest/run.py jython --include require-jython atest/robot

Required modules
----------------

Certain Robot Framework features require optional external modules to be
installed, and naturally tests related to these features require same modules
as well:

- `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ is needed with tests related
  to parsing test data in reStructuredText format.
- `PyYAML <http://pyyaml.org/>`__ is required with tests related to YAML
  variable files.
- `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`__ is needed with XML library tests.
- Screenshot library tests require a platform dependent module that can take
  screenshots. See `Screenshot library documentation`__ for details.

__ http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Screenshot.html

It is possible to install docutils, PyYAML and lxml using using ``pip`` either
individually or by using the provided `<requirements.txt>`__ file:

.. code:: bash

    # Install individually
    pip install 'docutils>=0.9'
    pip install pyyaml
    pip install lxml

    # Install using requirements.txt
    pip install -r atest/requirements.txt

Notice that the lxml module requires compilation on Linux. You can also install
it using a system package manager like ``apt-get install python-lxml``.
Additionally, lxml is not compatible with Jython or IronPython.

If a required module is not installed, it is possible to exclude tests
from the execution by using tags as explained in the `Test tags`_ section.
The lxml related tests are excluded with Jython and IronPython automatically.

Telnet tests
------------

Running telnet tests requires some extra setup. Instructions how to run them
can be found from `<testdata/standard_libraries/telnet/README.rst>`_.
If you don't want to run an unprotected telnet server on your machine, you can
always skip these tests by excluding tests with a tag ``telnet`` or ``no-ci``.
