class OperatingSystem(object):
    """A test library providing keywords for OS related tasks.

    ``OperatingSystem`` is Robot Framework's standard library that
    enables various operating system related tasks to be performed in
    the system where Robot Framework is running. It can, among other
    things, execute commands (e.g. `Run`), create and remove files and
    directories (e.g. `Create File`, `Remove Directory`), check
    whether files or directories exists or contain something
    (e.g. `File Should Exist`, `Directory Should Be Empty`) and
    manipulate environment variables (e.g. `Set Environment Variable`).

    == Table of contents ==

    - `Path separators`
    - `Pattern matching`
    - `Tilde expansion`
    - `Process library`
    - `Boolean arguments`
    - `Example`
    - `Shortcuts`
    - `Keywords`

    = Path separators =

    Because Robot Framework uses the backslash (``\\``) as an escape character
    in the test data, using a literal backslash requires duplicating it like
    in ``c:\\\\path\\\\file.txt``. That can be inconvenient especially with
    longer Windows paths, and thus all keywords expecting paths as arguments
    convert forward slashes to backslashes automatically on Windows. This also
    means that paths like ``${CURDIR}/path/file.txt`` are operating system
    independent.

    Notice that the automatic path separator conversion does not work if
    the path is only a part of an argument like with `Run` and `Start Process`
    keywords. In these cases the built-in variable ``${/}`` that contains
    ``\\`` or ``/``, dependiong on the operationg system, can be used instead.

    = Pattern matching =

    Some keywords allow their arguments to be specified as _glob patterns_
    where:
    | ``*``        | matches anything, even an empty string |
    | ``?``        | matches any single character |
    | ``[chars]``  | matches any character inside square brackets (e.g. ``[abc]`` matches either ``a``, ``b`` or ``c``) |
    | ``[!chars]`` | matches any character not inside square brackets |

    Unless otherwise noted, matching is case-insensitive on
    case-insensitive operating systems such as Windows. Pattern
    matching is implemented using
    [http://docs.python.org/library/fnmatch.html|fnmatch module].

    = Tilde expansion =

    Paths beginning with ``~`` or ``~username`` are expanded to the current or
    specified user's home directory, respectively. The resulting path is
    operating system dependent, but typically e.g. ``~/robot`` is expanded to
    ``C:\\Users\\<user>\\robot`` on Windows and ``/home/<user>/robot`` on
    Unixes.

    Tilde expansion is a new feature in Robot Framework 2.8. The ``~username``
    form does not work on Jython

    = Process library =

    [http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Process.html|
    Process library] that was added in Robot Framework 2.8 provides much more
    flexible keywords than this library for running processes in general and
    for starting processes on background in particular. Keywords provided
    by the Process library are thus recommended instead of `Run`, `Start
    Process`, and other related keywords in this library. `Start Process` was
    even deprecated in Robot Framework 2.9 and will be removed in the future.

    = Boolean arguments =

    Some keywords accept arguments that are handled as Boolean values true or
    false. If such an argument is given as a string, it is considered false if
    it is either empty or case-insensitively equal to ``false`` or ``no``.
    Other strings are considered true regardless their value, and other
    argument types are tested using same
    [http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing|rules
    as in Python].

    True examples:
    | `Remove Directory` | ${path} | recursive=True    | # Strings are generally true.    |
    | `Remove Directory` | ${path} | recursive=yes     | # Same as the above.             |
    | `Remove Directory` | ${path} | recursive=${TRUE} | # Python ``True`` is true.       |
    | `Remove Directory` | ${path} | recursive=${42}   | # Numbers other than 0 are true. |

    False examples:
    | `Remove Directory` | ${path} | recursive=False    | # String ``false`` is false.   |
    | `Remove Directory` | ${path} | recursive=no       | # Also string ``no`` is false. |
    | `Remove Directory` | ${path} | recursive=${EMPTY} | # Empty string is false.       |
    | `Remove Directory` | ${path} | recursive=${FALSE} | # Python ``False`` is false.   |

    Note that prior to Robot Framework 2.9, all non-empty strings, including
    ``false`` and ``no``, were considered true.

        """Runs the given command in the system and returns the output.

        The execution status of the command *is not checked* by this
        keyword, and it must be done separately based on the returned
        output. If the execution return code is needed, either `Run
        And Return RC` or `Run And Return RC And Output` can be used.

        The standard error stream is automatically redirected to the standard
        output stream by adding ``2>&1`` after the executed command. This
        automatic redirection is done only when the executed command does not
        contain additional output redirections. You can thus freely forward
        the standard error somewhere else, for example, like
        ``my_command 2>stderr.txt``.

        The returned output contains everything written into the standard
        output or error streams by the command (unless either of them
        is redirected explicitly). Many commands add an extra newline
        (``\\n``) after the output to make it easier to read in the
        console. To ease processing the returned output, this possible
        trailing newline is stripped by this keyword.

        Examples:
        | ${output} =        | Run       | ls -lhF /tmp |
        | Log                | ${output} |

        some operating systems (notable Windows) original return codes
        can be something else, but this keyword always maps them to
        the 0-255 range. Since the RC is an integer, it must be
        checked e.g. with the keyword `Should Be Equal As Integers`
        instead of `Should Be Equal` (both are built-in keywords).

        Starts the process in background and sets it as the active process.
        `Read Process Output` or `Stop Process` keywords affect this process
        unless `Switch Process` is used in between.

        If the command needs input through the standard input stream,
        it can be defined with the ``stdin`` argument.  It is not
        possible to give input to the command later. Possible command
        line arguments must be given as part of the command like
        ``/tmp/script.sh arg1 arg2``.

        Returns the index of this process. Indexing starts from 1, and indices
        can be used to switch between processes using `Switch Process` keyword.
        `Stop All Processes` can be used to reset indexing.

        The optional ``alias`` is a name for this process that may be used with
        `Switch Process` instead of the returned index.

        The standard error stream is redirected to the standard input

        involving strings are case-insensitive.

        1) If ``mtime`` is a number, or a string that can be converted

           timestamp formats are ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`` and
           ``YYYYMMDD hhmmss``.

        3) If ``mtime`` is equal to ``NOW``, the current local time is used.
           This time is got using Python's ``time.time()`` function.

        4) If ``mtime`` is equal to ``UTC``, the current time in
           [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time|UTC]
           is used. This time is got using ``time.time() + time.altzone``
           in Python.

        5) If ``mtime`` is in the format like ``NOW - 1 day`` or ``UTC + 1
           hour 30 min``, the current local/UTC time plus/minus the time
           specified with the time string is used. The time string format
           is described in an appendix of Robot Framework User Guide.

        Examples:
        | Set Modified Time | /path/file | 1177654467         | # Time given as epoch seconds |
        | Set Modified Time | /path/file | 2007-04-27 9:14:27 | # Time given as a timestamp   |
