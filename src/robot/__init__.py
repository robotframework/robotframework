The command line entry points provided by the framework are exposed for
programmatic usage as follows:

  * :func:`~robot.run.run`: Function to run tests.
  * :func:`~robot.run.run_cli`: Function to run tests
    with command line argument processing.
  * :func:`~robot.rebot.rebot`: Function to post-process outputs.
  * :func:`~robot.rebot.rebot_cli`: Function to post-process outputs
    with command line argument processing.
  * :mod:`~robot.libdoc`: Module for library documentation generation.
  * :mod:`~robot.testdoc`: Module for test case documentation generation.

All the functions above can be imported like ``from robot import run``.
Functions and classes provided by the modules need to be imported like
``from robot.libdoc import libdoc_cli``.

The functions and modules listed above are considered stable. Other modules in
this package are for for internal usage and may change without prior notice.

.. tip:: More public APIs are exposed by the :mod:`robot.api` package.
