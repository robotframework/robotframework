USAGE = """Rebot -- Robot Framework Report and Log Generator

Version:  <VERSION>

Usage:  rebot|jyrebot|ipyrebot [options] robot_outputs
   or:  python|jython|ipy -m robot.rebot [options] robot_outputs
   or:  python|jython|ipy path/to/robot/rebot.py [options] robot_outputs
   or:  java -jar robotframework.jar rebot [options] robot_outputs

Rebot can be used to generate logs and reports in HTML format. It can also
produce new XML output files which can be further processed with Rebot or
other tools.

Inputs to Rebot are XML output files generated by Robot Framework test runs or
earlier Rebot executions. When more than one input file is given, a new top
level test suite containing suites in the given files is created. This allows
combining multiple outputs together to create higher level reports.

Depending is Robot Framework installed using Python, Jython, or IronPython
interpreter, Rebot can be run using `rebot`, `jyrebot` or `ipyrebot` command,
respectively. Alternatively, it is possible to directly execute `robot.rebot`
module (e.g. `python -m robot.rebot`) or `robot/rebot.py` script using a
selected interpreter. Finally, there is also a standalone JAR distribution.

For more information about Robot Framework run, for example, `pybot --help` or
go to http://robotframework.org.

Options
=======

 -N --name name           Set the name of the top level test suite. Underscores
                          in the name are converted to spaces. Default name is
                          created from the name of the executed data source.
 -D --doc documentation   Set the documentation of the top level test suite.
                          Underscores in the documentation are converted to
                          spaces and it may also contain simple HTML formatting
                          (e.g. *bold* and http://url/).
 -M --metadata name:value *  Set metadata of the top level test suite.
                          Underscores in the name and value are converted to
                          spaces. Value can contain same HTML formatting as
                          --doc. Example: `--metadata version:1.2`
 -G --settag tag *        Sets given tag(s) to all executed test cases.
 -t --test name *         Select test cases to run by name or long name. Name
                          is case and space insensitive and it can also be a
                          simple pattern where `*` matches anything and `?`
                          matches any char. If using `*` and `?` in the console
                          is problematic see --escape and --argumentfile.
 -s --suite name *        Select test suites by name. When this option is used
                          with --test, --include or --exclude, only test cases
                          in matching suites and also matching other filtering
                          criteria are selected. Given name can be a simple
                          pattern similarly as with --test.
 -i --include tag *       Select test cases to run by tag. Similarly as name in
                          --test, tag is case and space insensitive. There are
                          three ways to include test based on tags:
                          1) One tag as a simple pattern. Tests having a tag
                          matching the pattern are included. Example: `it-*`
                          2) Two or more tags (or patterns) separated by `&` or
                          `AND`. Only tests having all these tags are included.
                          Examples: `tag1&tag2`, `smokeANDowner-*ANDit-10`
                          3) Two or more tags (or patterns) separated by `NOT`.
                          Tests having the first tag but not any of the latter
                          ones are included. Example: `it-10NOTsmoke`
 -e --exclude tag *       Select test cases not to run by tag. These tests are
                          not run even if they are included with --include.
                          Tags are excluded using the rules explained in
                          --include.
    --processemptysuite   Processes output also if the top level test suite is
                          empty. Useful e.g. with --include/--exclude when it
                          is not an error that no test matches the condition.
 -c --critical tag *      Tests having given tag are considered critical. If no
                          critical tags are set, all tags are critical. Tags
                          can be given as a pattern like e.g. with --test.
                          Resets possible critical tags set earlier.
 -n --noncritical tag *   Tests with given tag are not critical even if they
                          have a tag set with --critical. Tag can be a pattern.
                          Resets possible non critical tags set earlier.
 -d --outputdir dir       Where to create output files. The default is the
                          directory where Rebot is run from and the given path
                          is considered relative to that unless it is absolute.
 -o --output file         XML output file. Not created unless this option is
                          specified. Given path, similarly as paths given to
                          --log and --report, is relative to --outputdir unless
                          given as an absolute path. Default: output.xml
 -l --log file            HTML log file. Can be disabled by giving a special
                          name `NONE`. Examples: `--log mylog.html`, `-l none`
 -r --report file         HTML report file. Can be disabled with `NONE`
                          similarly as --log. Default is `report.html`.
 -x --xunitfile file      xUnit compatible result file. Not created unless this
                          option is specified.
 -T --timestampoutputs    When this option is used, timestamp in a format
                          `YYYYMMDD-hhmmss` is added to all generated output
                          files between their basename and extension. For
                          example `-T -o output.xml -r report.html -l none`
                          creates files like `output-20070503-154410.xml` and
                          `report-20070503-154410.html`.
    --splitlog            Split log file into smaller pieces that open in
                          browser transparently.
    --logtitle title      Title for the generated test log. The default title
                          is `<Name Of The Suite> Test Log`. Underscores in
                          the title are converted into spaces in all titles.
    --reporttitle title   Title for the generated test report. The default
                          title is `<Name Of The Suite> Test Report`.
    --reportbackground colors  Background colors to use in the report file.
                          Either `all_passed:critical_passed:failed` or
                          `passed:failed`. Both color names and codes work.
                          Examples: --reportbackground green:yellow:red
                                    --reportbackground #00E:#E00
 -L --loglevel level      Threshold for selecting messages. Available levels:
                          TRACE (default), DEBUG, INFO, WARN, NONE (no msgs).
                          Use syntax `LOGLEVEL:DEFAULT` to define the default
                          visible log level in log files.
                          Examples: --loglevel DEBUG
                                    --loglevel DEBUG:INFO
    --suitestatlevel level  How many levels to show in `Statistics by Suite`
                          in log and report. By default all suite levels are
                          shown. Example:  --suitestatlevel 3
    --tagstatinclude tag *  Include only matching tags in `Statistics by Tag`
                          and `Test Details` in log and report. By default all
                          tags set in test cases are shown. Given `tag` can
                          also be a simple pattern (see e.g. --test).
    --tagstatexclude tag *  Exclude matching tags from `Statistics by Tag` and
                          `Test Details`. This option can be used with
                          --tagstatinclude similarly as --exclude is used with
                          --include.
    --tagstatcombine tags:name *  Create combined statistics based on tags.
                          These statistics are added into `Statistics by Tag`
                          and matching tests into `Test Details`. If optional
                          `name` is not given, name of the combined tag is got
                          from the specified tags. Tags are combined using the
                          rules explained in --include.
                          Examples: --tagstatcombine tag1ANDtag2:My_name
                                    --tagstatcombine requirement-*
    --tagdoc pattern:doc *  Add documentation to tags matching given pattern.
                          Documentation is shown in `Test Details` and also as
                          a tooltip in `Statistics by Tag`. Pattern can contain
                          characters `*` (matches anything) and `?` (matches
                          any char). Documentation can contain formatting
                          similarly as with --doc option.
                          Examples: --tagdoc mytag:My_documentation
                                    --tagdoc regression:*See*_http://info.html
                                    --tagdoc owner-*:Original_author
    --tagstatlink pattern:link:title *  Add external links into `Statistics by
                          Tag`. Pattern can contain characters `*` (matches
                          anything) and `?` (matches any char). Characters
                          matching to wildcard expressions can be used in link
                          and title with syntax %N, where N is index of the
                          match (starting from 1). In title underscores are
                          automatically converted to spaces.
                          Examples: --tagstatlink mytag:http://my.domain:Link
                          --tagstatlink bug-*:http://tracker/id=%1:Bug_Tracker
    --removekeywords all|passed|for|wuks *  Remove keyword data from all
                          generated outputs. Keywords containing warnings are
                          not removed except in `all` mode.
                          all:    remove data from all keywords
                          passed: remove data only from keywords in passed
                                  test cases and suites
                          for:    remove passed iterations from for loops
                          wuks:   remove all but last failing keyword from
                                  `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`
    --starttime timestamp  Set starting time of test execution when creating
                          reports. Timestamp must be given in format
                          `2007-10-01 15:12:42.268` where all separators are
                          optional (e.g. `20071001151242268` is ok too) and
                          parts from milliseconds to hours can be omitted if
                          they are zero (e.g. `2007-10-01`). This can be used
                          to override starttime of the suite when reports are
                          created from a single suite or to set starttime for
                          combined suite, which is otherwise set to `N/A`.
    --endtime timestamp   Same as --starttime but for ending time. If both
                          options are used, elapsed time of the suite is
                          calculated based on them. For combined suites,
                          it is otherwise calculated by adding elapsed times
                          of combined test suites together.
    --nostatusrc          Sets the return code to zero regardless of failures
                          in test cases. Error codes are returned normally.
 -C --monitorcolors auto|on|ansi|off  Use colors on console output or not.
                          auto: use colors when output not redirected (default)
                          on:   always use colors
                          ansi: like `on` but use ANSI colors also on Windows
                          off:  disable colors altogether
                          Note that colors do not work with Jython on Windows.
 -E --escape what:with *  Escape characters which are problematic in console.
                          `what` is the name of the character to escape and
                          `with` is the string to escape it with. Note that
                          all given arguments, incl. data sources, are escaped
                          so escape characters ought to be selected carefully.
                          <---------------------ESCAPES----------------------->
                          Examples:
                          --escape space:_ --metadata X:Value_with_spaces
                          -E space:SP -E quot:Q -v var:QhelloSPworldQ
 -A --argumentfile path *  Text file to read more arguments from. File can have
                          both options and data sources one per line. Contents
                          do not need to be escaped but spaces in the beginning
                          and end of lines are removed. Empty lines and lines
                          starting with a hash character (#) are ignored.
                          Example file:
                          |  --include regression
                          |  --name Regression Tests
                          |  # This is a comment line
                          |  my_tests.html
                          |  path/to/test/directory/
 -h -? --help             Print usage instructions.
 --version                Print version information.

Options that are marked with an asterisk (*) can be specified multiple times.
For example, `--test first --test third` selects test cases with name `first`
and `third`. If other options are given multiple times, the last value is used.

Long option format is case-insensitive. For example, --SuiteStatLevel is
equivalent to but easier to read than --suitestatlevel. Long options can
also be shortened as long as they are unique. For example, `--logti Title`
works while `--lo log.html` does not because the former matches only --logtitle
but the latter matches both --log and --logtitle.

Environment Variables
=====================

ROBOT_SYSLOG_FILE         Path to the syslog file. If not specified, or set to
                          special value `NONE`, writing to syslog file is
                          disabled. Path must be absolute.
ROBOT_SYSLOG_LEVEL        Log level to use when writing to the syslog file.
                          Available levels are the same as for --loglevel
                          option to Robot and the default is INFO.
