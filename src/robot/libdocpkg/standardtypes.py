    bool: '''\
Strings ``TRUE``, ``YES``, ``ON`` and ``1`` are converted to Boolean ``True``,
the empty string as well as strings ``FALSE``, ``NO``, ``OFF`` and ``0``
are converted to Boolean ``False``, and the string ``NONE`` is converted
to the Python ``None`` object. Other strings and other accepted values are
passed as-is, allowing keywords to handle them specially if
needed. All string comparisons are case-insensitive.

Examples: ``TRUE`` (converted to ``True``), ``off`` (converted to ``False``),
``example`` (used as-is)
''',
    int: '''\
Conversion is done using Python's [https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#int|int]
built-in function. Floating point
numbers are accepted only if they can be represented as integers exactly.
For example, ``1.0`` is accepted and ``1.1`` is not.

Starting from RF 4.1, it is possible to use hexadecimal, octal and binary
numbers by prefixing values with ``0x``, ``0o`` and ``0b``, respectively.

Starting from RF 4.1, spaces and underscores can be used as visual separators
for digit grouping purposes.

Examples: ``42``, ``-1``, ``0b1010``, ``10 000 000``, ``0xBAD_C0FFEE``
''',

Conversion is done using Python's

    Decimal: '''\
Conversion is done using Python's

    bytes: '''\
Strings are converted to bytes so that each Unicode code point
below 256 is directly mapped to a matching byte. Higher code
points are not allowed. Robot Framework's ``\\xHH`` escape syntax is
convenient with bytes having non-printable values.

Examples: ``good``, ``hyv√§`` (same as ``hyv\\xE4``), ``\\x00`` (the null byte)

    datetime: '''\
Strings are expected to be a timestamp in
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601|ISO 8601] like
format ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.mmmmmm``, where any non-digit
character can be used as a separator or separators can be
omitted altogether. Additionally, only the date part is
mandatory, all possibly missing time components are considered
to be zeros.

Integers and floats are considered to represent seconds since
the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time|Unix epoch].

Examples: ``2022-02-09T16:39:43.632269``, ``2022-02-09 16:39``,
``${1644417583.632269}`` (Epoch time)

    timedelta: '''\
Strings are expected to represent a time interval in one of
the time formats Robot Framework supports:
- a number representing seconds like ``42`` or ``10.5``
- a time string like ``1 hour 2 seconds`` or ``1h 2s``
- a "timer" string like ``01:02`` (1 minute 2 seconds) or ``01:00:03`` (1 hour 3 seconds)

Integers and floats are considered to be seconds.

See the [https://robotframework.org/robotframework/|Robot Framework User Guide]
