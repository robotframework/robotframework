def keyword(name=None, tags=()):
    """Decorator to set custom keyword names and tags to functions and methods.

    This decorator creates the ``robot_name`` and ``robot_tags`` attributes on
    the decorated keyword method or function.  Robot Framework checks them to
    determine the keyword's name and tags, respectively.

    library.py::

        @keyword(name='Login Via User Panel')
        def login(username, password):
            # ...

        @keyword(name='Logout Via User Panel', tags=['example', 'tags'])
        def logout():
            # ...

    tests.robot::

        Login Via User Panel    myusername    mypassword

    If ``name`` is not given, the actual name of the keyword will not be
    affected, but the ``robot_name`` attribute will still be created.
    This can be useful for marking methods as keywords in a dynamic library.
    In this usage it is possible to also omit parenthesis when using the
    decorator::

        @keyword
        def func():
            # ...
    """
    if callable(name):
        return keyword()(name)
    def _method_wrapper(func):
        func.robot_name = name
        func.robot_tags = tags
        return func
    return _method_wrapper
