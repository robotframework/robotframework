Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to install Robot Framework:

`Installing from source`_
    You can get the source code either as a source distribution
    package or directly from version control system. In the former
    case, first extract the package somewhere, and as a result, you
    have a directory named ``robotframework-<version>``. Detailed
    instructions follow, but in short, what you need to do is to go to
    the created directory and run the ``python setup.py install``
    command.

`Using Windows installer`_
    There is a special graphical installer for Windows operating system.

`Using Easy Install`_
    If Python package managing tool `Easy Install`_ is available, installing
    Robot Framework is as easy as running command
    :cli:`easy_install robotframework`.

`Using One Click Installer`_
    If you are using Windows XP and you do not have preconditions (Python_ and
    optional Jython_) installed, you can use `One Click Installer`_ to do all
    the needed installations.

`Standalone jar distribution`_
    If you need to run tests with only Jython, the easiest way to install everything
    is to downloading the standalone :path:`robotframework-<version>.jar`, which contains
    both Jython and Robot Framework.

Installation packages are available from
http://downloads.robotframework.org, and source code from
http://source.robotframework.org.

.. note:: At the momemt it is not possible to install Robot Framework using
          pip__. For more information see `issue 885`__.

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework runs both on Python_ and Jython_, and you need to have at least
one of them to be able to use it. However, some of the provided installers only
work with Python, so installing it is always recommended.

Python installation
'''''''''''''''''''

Starting from Robot Framework 2.5, Python 2.5 is the minimum supported Python
version.  Earlier versions support Python 2.3 or newer. On most UNIX-like
systems, you have Python installed by default. If you are on Windows or
otherwise need to install Python yourself, your best place to start is probably
the `Python homepage`_. There you can download a suitable installer and get
more information about the installation and Python in general.

.. Note:: Robot Framework is currently not compatible with Python 3.x versions.
          Python 3.0 was intentionally backwards incompatible with earlier
          Python releases and Robot Framework has not yet been ported to
          support it.

.. Note:: On Windows, and especially on Windows Vista, it is
          recommended to install Python to all users, and to run the
          installation as an administrator.

Jython installation
'''''''''''''''''''

Using test libraries implemented with Java or using Java tools directly
requires running Robot Framework on Jython, which in turn requires Java Runtime
Environment (JRE). Jython 2.5 requires Java 1.5 or newer. Both Oracle/Sun and
IBM Java implementations are supported.

Starting from Robot Framework 2.5, the minimum supported Jython version is 2.5.
Earlier Robot Framework versions support also Jython 2.2.

Installing Jython is a fairly easy procedure, and the first step is getting an
installer from the `Jython homepage`_. Note that the installer is an executable
JAR package, which you need to run as :cli:`java -jar jython_installer-<version>.jar`.
Depending on your system, the installer runs either in graphical or textual
mode, but in both cases, the actual installation procedure is very easy.

There are three ways to install Robot Framework so that it can be run
with Jython.

1. With all supported Jython versions, it is possible to install Robot
   Framework using Python and still start execution using Jython.
   When installing Robot Framework with Python, its installer tries to
   find the Jython executable on the system to create the
   :prog:`jybot` runner script correctly. Jython is found if:

   - Jython can be executed in the system directly (i.e. it is in the
     :var:`PATH`).

   - An environment variable :var:`JYTHON_HOME` is set and it points
     to the Jython installation directory.

   - The installer finds the Jython installation directory from the
     system. On Windows, it is searched from the :path:`C:\\` and
     :path:`D:\\` drives, and on other systems from the
     :path:`/usr/local` and :path:`/opt` directories. The directory is
     found if it is under the searched directories mentioned above, or
     one level deeper. For example, the following Jython installation
     directories would be found by the installer::

        C:\APPS\Jython2.5.1
        D:\Jython251
        /usr/local/jython2.5.1
        /opt/whatever/Jython251

2. With Jython 2.5, it is possible to install Robot Framework without
   having Python available by `installing from source`_.

3. It is possible to do `manual installation`_.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing from source
''''''''''''''''''''''

You can get Robot Framework source code either directly from version
control or as a source distribution package that needs to be extracted
somewhere. In both cases, you should have a directory containing the
source code, documentation, tools, templates, and so on.

You should be able to install Robot Framework to any environment where
Python runs using a source distribution. The installation is done by
running the following command from the command line in the
extracted directory::

   python setup.py install

:prog:`setup.py` is a standard Python installer script. It can take
several parameters allowing, for example, installation into
non-default locations not requiring administrative rights. It is also
used for creating distribution packages.

:prog:`install.py` is a custom uninstallation_ script for Robot
Framework. It can also be used for installation, but it simply uses
:prog:`setup.py`, and thus is totally equivalent to the command above.

It is possible to install Robot Framework 2.5 also using Jython. In
this case the :prog:`pybot` runner script is not created.

With the installation you get a rather long output, and
something like the following text should appear at the end.
The actual output obviously depends on your environment.

::

   Creating Robot Framework runner scripts...
   Installation directory: /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/robot
   Python executable: /usr/bin/python
   Jython executable: /cygdrive/c/jython2.5/jython.bat (found from system)
   Pybot script: /usr/bin/pybot
   Jybot script: /usr/bin/jybot
   Rebot script: /usr/bin/rebot

Using Windows installer
'''''''''''''''''''''''

There are separate graphical installers for 32 bit (more common) and
64 bit Windows systems. The former installer has name in format
:path:`robotframework-<version>.win32.exe` and the latter
:path:`robotframework-<version>.win-amd64.exe`. The installation
itself requires only double clicking the appropriate installer and
following instructions.

After the installation you probably want to `set the environment`__ so
that Robot Framework runner scripts can be executed easily. Notice
that the framework is automatically installed `under the Python
installation`__ and that location cannot be altered at this point.

.. Note:: With Python 2.6 and 2.7 you need to add the Python installation
          directory into :var:`PATH` environment variable *before*
          running the Robot Framework installer. `Setting up environment`_
          section has more information about setting environment variables.

.. Note:: On Windows Vista and Windows 7 installing Robot Framework requires
          administrator privileges. Select ``Run as administrator`` from
          the context menu when starting the installer.

__ `Setting up environment`_
__ `Where files are installed`_

Using Easy Install
''''''''''''''''''

An obvious precondition for using `Easy Install`_ is to have it
installed, and you can refer to its documentation on how to do that on
your operating system. The command to install Robot Framework with
Easy Install depends on whether you want to install the latest version or
some specific version::

   easy_install robotframework         # latest version
   easy_install robotframework==2.1.3  # specified version

.. Tip:: If you need to use a proxy to access the Internet, you can
         tell Easy Install to use it by setting the :var:`http_proxy`
         environment variable.

.. Note:: Easy Install has a "feature" that unless a specific version
          is given, it installs the latest possible version even if
          that is an alpha or beta release. For example, if there is
          2.6 beta 1 available, running :cli:`easy_install robotframework`
          will install it and not the latest stable version. A
          workaround is giving the version explicitly like in
          :cli:`easy_install robotframework==2.5.7`.

On Windows the :prog:`pybot`, :prog:`jybot` and :prog:`rebot` `runner scripts`_
are not updated when using Easy Install. A workaround is running
:prog:`robot_postinstall.py` script manually afterwards. The installation
output tells where the post-install script is located, and you can either
double click it or run it from the command line. Path to the script depends on
your Python installation, but the command to run should be something like
:cli:`python C:\\Python25\\Scripts\\robot_postinstall.py`.

Updating the runner scripts is slightly fragile process in general and it
may not work with Easy Install on all environments. If the runner scripts
do not work after installation, they need to fixed manually.

Using One Click Installer
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

The One Click Installer installs Robot Framework and its preconditions Python_
and Jython_ (optional). It also automatically `sets up environment`__ so that
Robot Framework `runner scripts`_, as well as Python and Jython executables are
in :var:`PATH`.

.. Note:: The One Click Installer works only on Windows XP (32 bit).

__ `Setting up environment`_

The One Click Installer requires that you have downloaded all the required
component installers and have them in the same directory with it. More detailed
instructions and details about the supported installers are available at `One
Click Installer's documentation`__.

__ `One Click Installer`_

.. Note:: You should use this installer *ONLY* if you do not previously
          have Python or Jython installed. In that case, and also if you
          want to have a custom installation, you need to install
          the needed components separately.

Manual installation
'''''''''''''''''''

If you do not want to install Python, or for some other reason do not
want to use any automatic way of installing Robot Framework, you can
always do it manually following these steps:

1. Get the source code. All the code is in a directory (a module in
   Python) called :path:`robot`. If you have a source distribution or
   a version control checkout, you can find it from the :path:`src`
   directory, but you can also get it from an earlier installation.

2. Copy the source code where you want to.

3. Create the needed runner scripts. If you have a source package or
   a checkout, you can get templates from :path:`src/bin` directory.

Standalone jar distribution
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Starting from Robot Framework 2.5.2, it is also distributed as a standalone
``robotframework-<version>.jar``, which contains both Jython and Robot
Framework. It is an easy way to get everything if you do not need to run tests
with Python. After you have downloaded the jar file, you can execute it like::

  java -jar robotframework-2.5.2.jar --help
  java -jar robotframework-2.5.2.jar mytests.txt
  java -jar robotframework-2.5.2.jar --variable name:value mytests.txt

If you need to `post-process outputs`_, :cli:`rebot` must be given as the
first argument to the jar file::

  java -jar robotframework-2.5.2.jar rebot --help
  java -jar robotframework-2.5.2.jar rebot output.xml
  java -jar robotframework-2.5.2.jar rebot --name Combined outputs/*.xml

Where files are installed
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

When an automatic installer is used, the Robot Framework code is copied
into a directory containing external Python modules. The actual
location is platform-specific, but on computers with a UNIX-like
operating system, it is normally something like
:path:`/usr/lib/[PythonVer]/site-packages`, and on Windows it is
:path:`[PythonInstallationDir]\\Lib\\site-packages`. The actual Robot
Framework code is in a directory named :path:`robot`, or when `using Easy Install`_
in directory :path:`robotframework[RobotVer].py[PythonVer].egg/robot`.

Robot Framework runner scripts (:prog:`pybot`, :prog:`jybot` and
:prog:`rebot`) are created and copied into another platform-specific
location. On UNIX-like systems, they normally go to :path:`/usr/bin`
and are thus immediately available from the command line. On Windows,
the operating system does not provide a similar natural place, and
Python copies these scripts into :path:`[PythonInstallationDir]\\Scripts`.

Setting up environment
''''''''''''''''''''''

After the installation, you probably want to make Robot Framework's
`runner scripts`_ easily available from the command line. On UNIX-like
systems, that should be the case automatically, but for example on
Windows, it is not. In environments where runners are not
available, the directory containing them must be set to the :var:`PATH`
environment variable.

Setting the :var:`PATH` environment variable on Windows:

1. Open ``Start > Settings > Control Panel > System > Advanced >
   Environment Variables``.  There are ``User variables`` and ``System
   variables``, and the difference between them is that User variables
   affect only the current users, whereas System variables affect all
   users.

2. To edit the existing :var:`PATH`, select ``Edit`` and add
   :path:`;[PythonInstallationDir]\\Scripts\\` at the end of the
   value. Note that the leading colon (:path:`;`) is important, as it
   separates different entries. To add a new value, select ``New`` and
   provide both the name and the value, this time without the colon.

3. Start a new command prompt for the changes to take effect.

Python installer on Windows does not create
:path:`[PythonInstallationDir]\\Scripts` directory, but it is automatically
created during Robot Framework installation.

.. Note:: Environment variable :var:`PYTHONCASEOK` should not be set on
          Windows machines. Robot Framework will not work correctly with
          this environment variable.

Verifying installation
''''''''''''''''''''''

To verify that the installation and environment setup were successful,
type::

   $ pybot --version
   Robot Framework 2.5 (Python 2.6.5 on darwin)

To verify that Robot Framework works also with Jython, type::

   $ jybot --version
   Robot Framework 2.5 (Jython 2.5.1 on java1.6.0_07)

In both cases, the exact version and platform information can, of course,
differ from these. On Jython, you may also get some notifications from
Jython package manager upon the first execution.

Uninstallation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Robot Framework has been installed using a source distribution, it
can be uninstalled with command::

   python install.py uninstall

If Robot Framework is installed from a binary distribution, it can be
uninstalled via the mechanism offered by the operating system. For
example, in Windows you simply go to ``Control Panel >
Add/Remove Programs``, where Robot Framework is listed under Python.

If uninstallation fails somehow or you have `used Easy Install`__,
Robot Framework can be uninstalled by removing the `framework code and
runner scripts`__ manually.

__ `Using Easy Install`_
__ `Where files are installed`_

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

The procedure when upgrading or downgrading Robot Framework depends on
the versions used:

- If you are upgrading from one minor Robot Framework version to
  another (for example, from 2.5 to 2.5.1), it is safe to install the
  new version over the old one, unless stated otherwise.

- If you are upgrading from one major Robot Framework version to
  another (for example, from 2.1.3 to 2.5), then it is highly
  recommended to uninstall the old version before the new
  installation.

- If you are downgrading, the rules are the same as for upgrading.

With source distributions, you first need to get the new package, and
after that run the following command, which automatically takes care
of the uninstallation::

   python install.py reinstall

If you are `using Easy Install`_, it is enough to run::

   easy_install robotframework==<new-version>

Regardless on the version or installation method, you do not need to
reinstall preconditions or set the :var:`PATH` environment variable again.
