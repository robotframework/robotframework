Configuring execution
---------------------

This section explains different command line options that can be used
for configuring the `test execution`_ or `post-processing
outputs`_. Options related to generated output files are discussed in
the `next section`__.

Selecting test cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework offers several command line options for selecting
which test cases to execute. The same options also work when
post-processing outputs with the :prog:`rebot` tool.

By test suite and test case names
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Test suites and test cases can be selected by their names with the command
line options :opt:`--suite (-s)` and :opt:`--test (-t)`,
respectively.  Both of these options can be used several times to
select several test suites or cases. Arguments to these options are
case- and space-insensitive, and there can also be `simple
patterns`_ matching multiple names.  If both the :opt:`--suite` and
:opt:`--test` options are used, only test cases in matching suites
with matching names are selected.

::

  --test Example
  --test mytest --test yourtest
  --test example*
  --test mysuite.mytest
  --test *.suite.mytest
  --suite example-??
  --suite mysuite --test mytest --test your*

.. note:: Selecting test cases using long name (e.g. :name:`mysuite.mytest`)
          works with Robot Framework 2.5.6 and newer.

Using the :opt:`--suite` option is more or less the same as executing only
the appropriate test case file or directory. One major benefit is the
possibility to select the suite based on its parent suite. The syntax
for this is specifying both the parent and child suite names separated
with a dot. In this case, the possible setup and teardown of the parent
suite are executed.

::

  --suite parent.child
  --suite myhouse.myhousemusic --test jack*

Selecting individual test cases with the :opt:`--test` option is very
practical when creating test cases, but quite limited when running tests
automatically. The :opt:`--suite` option can be useful in that
case, but in general, selecting test cases by tag names is more
flexible.

By tag names
''''''''''''

It is possible to include and exclude test cases by tag_ names with the
:opt:`--include (-i)` and :opt:`--exclude (-e)` options,
respectively. When the former is used, only test cases having a
matching tag are selected, and with the latter, test cases having a
matching tag are not. If both are used, only tests with a tag
matching the former option, and not with a tag matching the latter,
are selected.

::

   --include example
   --exclude not_ready
   --include regression --exclude long_lasting

Both :opt:`--include` and :opt:`--exclude` can be used several
times to match multiple tags, and their arguments can be `simple
patterns`_. In these cases, the rules for selecting test cases apply,
so that test cases with a tag matching any include patterns are
selected, and tests with a tag matching exclude patterns are not. It
is also possible to select only test cases that have two or more
specified tags by separating the tags either with :code:`&` or
:code:`AND` (case-sensitive). Starting from Robot Framework 2.1.3, only tests
with a certain tag, but without any others, can be selected by separating these
tags with :code:`NOT` (case-sensitive). If any of the patterns between
multiple :code:`NOT` is matching, the test case is not selected.

::

  --include req-*
  --include regressionANDiter-42
  --include tag1&tag2&tag3&tag4
  --exclude regressionNOTowner-*
  --include tag1NOTtag2NOTtag3&tag4  (includes tests which have `tag1`, but not tests which additionally have `tag2` or both tags `tag3` and `tag4`)

Selecting test cases by tags is a very flexible mechanism and allows
many interesting possibilities:

- A subset of tests to be executed before other tests can be tagged
  with :opt:`smoke` and executed with :cli:`--include smoke`.

- Unfinished test can be committed to version control with the tag
  :opt:`not_ready` and excluded from the test execution with
  :cli:`--exclude not_ready`.

- Tests can be tagged with :opt:`iter-<num>`, where
  :opt:`<num>` specifies the number of the current iteration, and
  after executing all test cases, a separate report containing only
  the tests for a certain iteration can be generated (for example, :cli:`rebot
  --include iter-42 output.xml`).

When no tests match selection
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

By default when no tests match the selection criteria test execution fails
with an error like::

    [ ERROR ] Suite 'Example' with includes 'xxx' contains no test cases.

Because no outputs are generated, this behavior can be problematic if tests
are executed and results processed automatically. Luckily a command line
option :opt:`--RunEmptySuite` can be used to force the suite to be executed
also in this case. As a result normal outputs are created but show zero
executed tests. The same option can be used also to alter the behavior when
an empty directory or a test case file containing no tests is executed.

Similar situation can occur also when processing output files with rebot_.
It is possible that no test match the used filtering criteria or that
the output file contained no tests to begin with. By default executing
:prog:`rebot` fails in these cases, but it has a separate
:opt:`--ProcessEmptySuite` option that can be used to alter the behavior.
In practice this option works the same way as :opt:`--RunEmptySuite` when
running tests.

.. note:: :opt:`--RunEmptySuite` option was added Robot Framework 2.6
          and :opt:`--ProcessEmptySuite` in 2.7.2.

Setting criticality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final result of test execution is determined on the basis of
critical tests. If a single critical test fails, the whole test run is
considered failed. On the other hand, non-critical test cases can
fail and the overall status is still passed.

By default, all test cases are critical, but this can be changed with
the :opt:`--critical (-c)` and :opt:`--noncritical (-n)`
options. These options specify which test cases are consider critical
based on tags, similarly as :opt:`--include` and
:opt:`--exclude` are used to `select test cases by tag
names`__. If only :opt:`--critical` is used, test cases with a
matching tag are critical. If only :opt:`--noncritical` is used,
tests without a matching tag are critical. Finally, if both are
used, only test with a critical tag but without a non-critical tag are
considered critical.  Both of these options accept `simple patterns`_
and can be given several times::

  --critical regression
  --noncritical not_ready
  --critical iter-* --critical req-* --noncritical req-6??

The most common use case for setting criticality is having test cases
that are not ready or test features still under development in the
test execution. Of course, these tests could be excluded from the
test execution altogether with the :opt:`--exclude` option, but
including them as non-critical tests enables you to see when
they start to pass.

`Starting from Robot Framework 2.1`__ criticality set when tests are
executed is not stored anywhere. If you want to keep same criticality
when `post-processing outputs`_ with :prog:`rebot`, you need to
use :opt:`--critical` and/or :opt:`--noncritical` also with it::

  # Use rebot to create new log and report from the output created during execution
  pybot --critical regression --outputdir all my_tests.html
  rebot --name Smoke --include smoke --critical regression --outputdir smoke all/output.xml

  # No need to use --critical/--noncritical when no log or report is created
  jybot --log NONE --report NONE my_tests.html
  rebot --critical feature1 output.xml

Setting metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting the name
''''''''''''''''

When Robot Framework parses test data, `test suite names are created
from file and directory names`__. The name of the top-level test suite
can, however, be overridden with the command line option
:opt:`--name (-N)`. Underscores in the given name are converted to
spaces automatically, and words in the name capitalized.

__ `Test suite name and documentation`_


Setting the documentation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

In addition to `defining documentation in the test data`__, documentation
of the top-level suite can be given from the command line with the
option :opt:`--doc (-D)`. Underscores in the given documentation
are converted to spaces, and it may contain simple `HTML formatting`_.

__ `Test suite name and documentation`_

Setting free metadata
'''''''''''''''''''''

`Free test suite metadata`_ may also be given from the command line with the
option :opt:`--metadata (-M)`. The argument must be in the format
:opt:`name:value`, where :opt:`name` the name of the metadata to set and
:opt:`value` is its value. Underscores in the name and value are converted to
spaces, and the latter may contain simple `HTML formatting`_. This option may
be used several times to set multiple metadata.

Setting tags
''''''''''''

The command line option :opt:`--settag (-G)` can be used to set
the given tag to all executed test cases. This option may be used
several times to set multiple tags.

Adjusting library search path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a `test library is taken into use`__, Robot Framework uses the Python
or Jython interpreter to import a module implementing the library from
the system. The location where these modules are searched from is called
PYTHONPATH, and when running tests on Jython or using the jar distribution,
also Java CLASSPATH is used.

Adjusting the library search path so that libraries are found is
a requirement for successful test execution. In addition to
find test libraries, the search path is also used to find `listeners
set on the command line`__. There are various ways to alter
PYTHONPATH and CLASSPATH, but regardless of the selected approach, it is
recommended to use a `custom start-up script`__.

__ `Setting listeners`_
__ `Creating start-up scripts`_

Locations automatically in PYTHONPATH
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Python and Jython installations put their own library directories into
PYTHONPATH automatically. This means that test libraries `packaged
using Python's own packaging system`__ are automatically installed
into a location that is in the library search path. Robot Framework
also puts the directory containing its `standard libraries`_ and the
directory where tests are executed from into PYTHONPATH.

__ `Packaging libraries`_

Setting PYTHONPATH
''''''''''''''''''

There are several ways to alter PYTHONPATH in the system, but the most
common one is setting an environment variable with the same name
before the test execution. Jython actually does not use PYTHONPATH
environment variable normally, but Robot Framework ensures that
locations listed in it are added into the library search path
regardless of the interpreter.

Setting CLASSPATH
'''''''''''''''''

CLASSPATH is used with Jython or when using the standalone jar.

When using Jython the most common way to alter CLASSPATH is setting an
environment variable similarly as with PYTHONPATH. Note that instead of
CLASSPATH, it is always possible to use PYTHONPATH with Jython, even with
libraries and listeners implemented with Java.

When using the standalone jar distribution, the CLASSPATH has to be set a
bit differently, due to the fact that `java -jar` command does not read
the CLASSPATH environment variable. In this case, there are two different
ways to configure CLASSPATH, which are shown in the examples below::

  java -cp lib/testlibrary.jar:lib/app.jar:robotframework-2.7.1.jar org.robotframework.RobotFramework example.txt

  java -Xbootclasspath/a:lib/testlibrary.jar:lib/app.jar -jar robotframework-2.7.1.jar example.txt

Using --pythonpath option
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Robot Framework also has a separate command line option
:opt:`--pythonpath (-P)` for adding directories or archives into
PYTHONPATH. Multiple paths can be given by separating them with a
colon (:) or using this option several times. The given path can also be
a glob pattern matching multiple paths, but then it normally must be
escaped__.

__ `Escaping complicated characters`_

Examples::

   --pythonpath libs/
   --pythonpath /opt/testlibs:mylibs.zip:yourlibs
   --pythonpath mylib.jar --pythonpath lib/STAR.jar --escape star:STAR

Setting variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables_ can be set from the command line either individually__
using the :opt:`--variable (-v)` option or through `variable files`_
with the :opt:`--variablefile (-V)` option. Variables and variable
files are explained in separate chapters, but the following examples
illustrate how to use these options::

  --variable name:value
  --variable OS:Linux --variable IP:10.0.0.42
  --variablefile path/to/variables.py
  --variablefile myvars.py:possible:arguments:here
  --variable ENVIRONMENT:Windows --variablefile c:\resources\windows.py

__ `Setting variables in command line`_

Dry run
~~~~~~~

Robot Framework supports so called *dry run* mode where the tests are
run normally otherwise, but the keywords coming from the test libraries
are not executed at all. The dry run mode can be used to validate the
test data; if the dry run passes, the data should be syntactically
correct.  This mode is triggered using option :opt:`--runmode DryRun`
(case-insensitive) and it is supported starting from Robot Framework
2.5.

The dry run execution may fail for following reasons:

  * Using keywords that are not found.
  * Using keywords with wrong number of arguments.
  * Using user keywords that have invalid syntax.

In addition to these failures, normal `execution errors`__ are shown,
for example, when test library or resource file imports cannot be
resolved.

.. note:: The dry run mode does not validate variables. This
          limitation may be lifted in the future releases.

__ `Errors and warnings during execution`_

Randomizing execution order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :opt:`--runmode` option can also be used to randomize the test
execution order. This is done using the different values explained
below.

:opt:`random:test`
    Test cases inside each test suite are executed in random
    order.

:opt:`random:suite`
    All test suites are executed in a random order, but test cases inside
    suites are run in the order they are defined.

:opt:`random:all`
    Both test cases and test suites are executed in a random
    order.

Example::

    pybot --runmode random:test my_test.txt

Controlling console output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Console width
'''''''''''''

The width of the test execution output in the console can be set using
the option :opt:`--monitorwidth (-W)`. The default width is 78 characters.

.. tip:: On many UNIX-like machines you can use handy :var:`$COLUMNS`
         variable like :cli:`--monitorwidth $COLUMNS`.

Console colors
''''''''''''''

The :opt:`--monitorcolors (-C)` option is used to control whether
colors should be used in the console output. Colors should work on all
other platforms except for Windows when using Jython. This option has
following case-insensitive values:

:opt:`auto`
    Colors are enabled when output is written into the console but
    not when it is redirected into a file. This is the default and there
    is rarely need to change it.

:opt:`on`
    Colors are used also when output is redirected into a file.
    Does not have effect on Windows.

:opt:`off`
    Colors are disabled.

:opt:`force`
    Backwards compatibility with Robot Framework 2.5.5 and older.
    Should not be used.

.. note:: Support for colors on Windows and the :opt:`auto` mode are
          new features in Robot Framework 2.5.6.

Setting listeners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So-called listeners_ can be used for monitoring the test
execution. They are taken into use with the command line option
:opt:`--listener`, and the specified listeners must be in the `module
search path`_ similarly as test libraries.
