External tools
==============

There are plenty of external tools that can be used with Robot Framework.
These tools include plugins for various IDEs and text editors, tools for
parallel execution and data-driven testing, plugins for continuous integration
systems, and so on.

These tools are developed as separate projects independently from Robot
Framework itself. For a list of the available tools see http://robotframework.org/.
