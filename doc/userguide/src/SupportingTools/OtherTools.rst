External tools
==============

There are plenty of external tools that can be used with Robot Framework.
These tools include test data editor RIDE_, extensions for various IDEs and
text editors, plugins to continuous integration systems and build tools,
and so on.

These tools are developed as separate projects independently from Robot
Framework itself. For a list of the available tools see
http://robotframework.org/#tools.
