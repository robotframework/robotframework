Resource and variable files
===========================

User keywords and variables in `test case files`_ and `test suite
initialization files`_ can only be used in files where they are
created, but *resource files* provide a mechanism for sharing them.
The high level syntax for creating resource files is exactly the same
as when creating test case files and `supported file formats`_ are the same
as well. The main difference is that resource files cannot have tests.

*Variable files* provide a powerful mechanism for creating and sharing
variables. For example, they allow values other than strings and
enable creating variables dynamically. Their flexibility comes from
the fact that they are created using Python code, which also makes
them somewhat more complicated than `Variable tables`_.

Resource files
--------------

Taking resource files into use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resource files are imported using the :setting:`Resource` setting in the
Settings section. The path to the resource file is given as an argument
to the setting. When using the `plain text format`__ for creating resource
files, it is possible to use the normal :file:`.robot` extension but the
dedicated :file:`.resource` extension is recommended to separate resource
files from test case files.

__ `Supported file formats`_

If the path is given in an absolute format, it is used directly. In other
cases, the resource file is first searched relatively to the directory
where the importing file is located. If the file is not found there,
it is then searched from the directories in Python's `module search path`_.
The path can contain variables, and it is recommended to use them to make paths
system-independent (for example, :file:`${RESOURCES}/login.resource` or
:file:`${RESOURCE_PATH}`). Additionally, forward slashes (`/`) in the path
are automatically changed to backslashes (:codesc:`\\`) on Windows.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Settings ***
   Resource    example.resource
   Resource    ../data/resources.robot
   Resource    ${RESOURCES}/common.resource

The user keywords and variables defined in a resource file are
available in the file that takes that resource file into
use. Similarly available are also all keywords and variables from the
libraries, resource files and variable files imported by the said
resource file.

.. note:: The :file:`.resource` extension is new in Robot Framework 3.1.

Resource file structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The higher-level structure of resource files is the same as that of
test case files otherwise, but, of course, they cannot contain Test
Case tables. Additionally, the Setting table in resource files can
contain only import settings (:setting:`Library`, :setting:`Resource`,
:setting:`Variables`) and :setting:`Documentation`. The Variable table and
Keyword table are used exactly the same way as in test case files.

If several resource files have a user keyword with the same name, they
must be used so that the `keyword name is prefixed with the resource
file name`__ without the extension (for example, :name:`myresources.Some
Keyword` and :name:`common.Some Keyword`). Moreover, if several resource
files contain the same variable, the one that is imported first is
taken into use.

__ `Handling keywords with same names`_

Documenting resource files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keywords created in a resource file can be documented__ using
:setting:`[Documentation]` setting. The resource file itself can have
:setting:`Documentation` in the Setting table similarly as
`test suites`__.

Both Libdoc_ and RIDE_ use these documentations, and they
are naturally available for anyone opening resource files.  The
first logical line of the documentation of a keyword, until the first
empty line, is logged when the keyword is run, but otherwise resource
file documentation is ignored during the test execution.

Variable files
--------------

Variable files contain variables_ that can be used in the test
data. Variables can also be created using variable tables or set from
the command line, but variable files allow creating them dynamically
and also make it easy to create other variable values than strings.

Variable files are typically implemented as Python modules and there are
two different approaches for creating variables:

`Getting variables directly from a module`_
   Variables are specified as module attributes. In simple cases, the
   syntax is so simple that no real programming is needed. For example,
   `MY_VAR = 'my value'` creates a variable `${MY_VAR}` with the specified
   text as its value. One limitation of this approach is that it does
   not allow using arguments.

`Getting variables from a special function`_
   Variable files can have a special `get_variables`
   (or `getVariables`) method that returns variables as a mapping.
   Because the method can take arguments this approach is very flexible.

Alternatively variable files can be implemented as `Python or Java classes`__
that the framework will instantiate. Also in this case it is possible to create
variables as attributes or get them dynamically from the `get_variables`
method. Variable files can also be created as `YAML files`__.

Taking variable files into use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting table
'''''''''''''

All test data files can import variables using the
:setting:`Variables` setting in the Setting table, in the same way as
`resource files are imported`__ using the :setting:`Resource`
setting. Similarly to resource files, the path to the imported
variable file is considered relative to the directory where the
importing file is, and if not found, it is searched from the
directories in the `module search path`_. The path can also contain variables,
and slashes are converted to backslashes on Windows. If an `argument file takes
arguments`__, they are specified in the cells after the path and also they
can contain variables.

__ `Taking resource files into use`_
__ `Getting variables from a special function`_

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Settings ***
   Variables    myvariables.py
   Variables    ../data/variables.py
   Variables    ${RESOURCES}/common.py
   Variables    taking_arguments.py    arg1    ${ARG2}

All variables from a variable file are available in the test data file
that imports it. If several variable files are imported and they
contain a variable with the same name, the one in the earliest imported file is
taken into use. Additionally, variables created in Variable tables and
set from the command line override variables from variable files.

Command line
''''''''''''

Another way to take variable files into use is using the command line option
:option:`--variablefile`. Variable files are referenced using a path to them,
and possible arguments are joined to the path with a colon (`:`)::

   --variablefile myvariables.py
   --variablefile path/variables.py
   --variablefile /absolute/path/common.py
   --variablefile taking_arguments.py:arg1:arg2

Variable files taken into use from the
command line are also searched from the `module search path`_ similarly as
variable files imported in the Setting table.

If a variable file is given as an absolute Windows path, the colon after the
drive letter is not considered a separator::

   --variablefile C:\path\variables.py

It is also possible to use a semicolon
(`;`) as an argument separator. This is useful if variable file arguments
themselves contain colons, but requires surrounding the whole value with
quotes on UNIX-like operating systems::

   --variablefile "myvariables.py;argument:with:colons"
   --variablefile C:\path\variables.py;D:\data.xls

Variables in these variable files are globally available in all test data
files, similarly as `individual variables`__ set with the
:option:`--variable` option. If both :option:`--variablefile` and
:option:`--variable` options are used and there are variables with same
names, those that are set individually with
:option:`--variable` option take precedence.

__ `Setting variables in command line`_

Getting variables directly from a module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic syntax
''''''''''''

When variable files are taken into use, they are imported as Python
modules and all their module level attributes that do not start with
an underscore (`_`) are, by default, considered to be variables. Because
variable names are case-insensitive, both lower- and upper-case names are
possible, but in general, capital letters are recommended for global
variables and attributes.

.. sourcecode:: python

   VARIABLE = "An example string"
   ANOTHER_VARIABLE = "This is pretty easy!"
   INTEGER = 42
   STRINGS = ["one", "two", "kolme", "four"]
   NUMBERS = [1, INTEGER, 3.14]
   MAPPING = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}

In the example above, variables `${VARIABLE}`, `${ANOTHER VARIABLE}`, and
so on, are created. The first two variables are strings, the third one is
an integer, then there are two lists, and the final value is a dictionary.
All these variables can be used as a `scalar variable`_, lists and the
dictionary also a `list variable`_ like `@{STRINGS}` (in the dictionary's case
that variable would only contain keys), and the dictionary also as a
`dictionary variable`_ like `&{MAPPING}`.

To make creating a list variable or a dictionary variable more explicit,
it is possible to prefix the variable name with `LIST__` or `DICT__`,
respectively:

.. sourcecode:: python

   from collections import OrderedDict

   LIST__ANIMALS = ["cat", "dog"]
   DICT__FINNISH = OrderedDict([("cat", "kissa"), ("dog", "koira")])

These prefixes will not be part of the final variable name, but they cause
Robot Framework to validate that the value actually is list-like or
dictionary-like. With dictionaries the actual stored value is also turned
into a special dictionary that is used also when `creating dictionary
variables`_ in the Variable table. Values of these dictionaries are accessible
as attributes like `${FINNISH.cat}`. These dictionaries are also ordered, but
preserving the source order requires also the original dictionary to be
ordered.

The variables in both the examples above could be created also using the
Variable table below.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Variables ***
   ${VARIABLE}            An example string
   ${ANOTHER VARIABLE}    This is pretty easy!
   ${INTEGER}             ${42}
   @{STRINGS}             one          two           kolme         four
   @{NUMBERS}             ${1}         ${INTEGER}    ${3.14}
   &{MAPPING}             one=${1}     two=${2}      three=${3}
   @{ANIMALS}             cat          dog
   &{FINNISH}             cat=kissa    dog=koira

.. note:: Variables are not replaced in strings got from variable files.
          For example, `VAR = "an ${example}"` would create
          variable `${VAR}` with a literal string value
          `an ${example}` regardless would variable `${example}`
          exist or not.

Using objects as values
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Variables in variable files are not limited to having only strings or
other base types as values like variable tables. Instead, their
variables can contain any objects. In the example below, the variable
`${MAPPING}` contains a Java Hashtable with two values (this
example works only when running tests on Jython).

.. sourcecode:: python

    from java.util import Hashtable

    MAPPING = Hashtable()
    MAPPING.put("one", 1)
    MAPPING.put("two", 2)

The second example creates `${MAPPING}` as a Python dictionary
and also has two variables created from a custom object implemented in
the same file.

.. sourcecode:: python

    MAPPING = {'one': 1, 'two': 2}

    class MyObject:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

    OBJ1 = MyObject('John')
    OBJ2 = MyObject('Jane')

Creating variables dynamically
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Because variable files are created using a real programming language,
they can have dynamic logic for setting variables.

.. sourcecode:: python

   import os
   import random
   import time

   USER = os.getlogin()                # current login name
   RANDOM_INT = random.randint(0, 10)  # random integer in range [0,10]
   CURRENT_TIME = time.asctime()       # timestamp like 'Thu Apr  6 12:45:21 2006'
   if time.localtime()[3] > 12:
       AFTERNOON = True
   else:
       AFTERNOON = False

The example above uses standard Python libraries to set different
variables, but you can use your own code to construct the values. The
example below illustrates the concept, but similarly, your code could
read the data from a database, from an external file or even ask it from
the user.

.. sourcecode:: python

    import math

    def get_area(diameter):
        radius = diameter / 2
        area = math.pi * radius * radius
        return area

    AREA1 = get_area(1)
    AREA2 = get_area(2)

Selecting which variables to include
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When Robot Framework processes variable files, all their attributes
that do not start with an underscore are expected to be
variables. This means that even functions or classes created in the
variable file or imported from elsewhere are considered variables. For
example, the last example would contain the variables `${math}`
and `${get_area}` in addition to `${AREA1}` and
`${AREA2}`.

Normally the extra variables do not cause problems, but they
could override some other variables and cause hard-to-debug
errors. One possibility to ignore other attributes is prefixing them
with an underscore:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import math as _math

    def _get_area(diameter):
        radius = diameter / 2.0
        area = _math.pi * radius * radius
        return area

    AREA1 = _get_area(1)
    AREA2 = _get_area(2)

If there is a large number of other attributes, instead of prefixing
them all, it is often easier to use a special attribute
`__all__` and give it a list of attribute names to be processed
as variables.

.. sourcecode:: python

    import math

    __all__ = ['AREA1', 'AREA2']

    def get_area(diameter):
        radius = diameter / 2.0
        area = math.pi * radius * radius
        return area

    AREA1 = get_area(1)
    AREA2 = get_area(2)

.. Note:: The `__all__` attribute is also, and originally, used
          by Python to decide which attributes to import
          when using the syntax `from modulename import *`.

The third option to select what variables are actually created is using
a special `get_variables` function discussed below.

Getting variables from a special function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An alternative approach for getting variables is having a special
`get_variables` function (also camelCase syntax `getVariables` is possible)
in a variable file. If such a function exists, Robot Framework calls it and
expects to receive variables as a Python dictionary or a Java `Map` with
variable names as keys and variable values as values. Created variables can
be used as scalars, lists, and dictionaries exactly like when `getting
variables directly from a module`_, and it is possible to use `LIST__` and
`DICT__` prefixes to make creating list and dictionary variables more explicit.
The example below is functionally identical to the first example related to
`getting variables directly from a module`_.

.. sourcecode:: python

    def get_variables():
        variables = {"VARIABLE ": "An example string",
                     "ANOTHER VARIABLE": "This is pretty easy!",
                     "INTEGER": 42,
                     "STRINGS": ["one", "two", "kolme", "four"],
                     "NUMBERS": [1, 42, 3.14],
                     "MAPPING": {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}}
        return variables

`get_variables` can also take arguments, which facilitates changing
what variables actually are created. Arguments to the function are set just
as any other arguments for a Python function. When `taking variable files
into use`_ in the test data, arguments are specified in cells after the path
to the variable file, and in the command line they are separated from the
path with a colon or a semicolon.

The dummy example below shows how to use arguments with variable files. In a
more realistic example, the argument could be a path to an external text file
or database where to read variables from.

.. sourcecode:: python

    variables1 = {'scalar': 'Scalar variable',
                  'LIST__list': ['List','variable']}
    variables2 = {'scalar' : 'Some other value',
                  'LIST__list': ['Some','other','value'],
                  'extra': 'variables1 does not have this at all'}

    def get_variables(arg):
        if arg == 'one':
            return variables1
        else:
            return variables2

Implementing variable file as Python or Java class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to implement variables files also as Python or Java classes.

Implementation
''''''''''''''

Because variable files are always imported using a file system path, creating
them as classes has some restrictions:

  - Python classes must have the same name as the module they are located.
  - Java classes must live in the default package.
  - Paths to Java classes must end with either :file:`.java` or :file:`.class`.
    The class file must exists in both cases.

Regardless the implementation language, the framework will create an instance
of the class using no arguments and variables will be gotten from the instance.
Similarly as with modules, variables can be defined as attributes directly
in the instance or gotten from a special `get_variables`
(or `getVariables`) method.

When variables are defined directly in an instance, all attributes containing
callable values are ignored to avoid creating variables from possible methods
the instance has. If you would actually need callable variables, you need
to use other approaches to create variable files.

Examples
''''''''

The first examples create variables from attributes using both Python and Java.
Both of them create variables `${VARIABLE}` and `@{LIST}` from class
attributes and `${ANOTHER VARIABLE}` from an instance attribute.

.. sourcecode:: python

    class StaticPythonExample(object):
        variable = 'value'
        LIST__list = [1, 2, 3]
        _not_variable = 'starts with an underscore'

        def __init__(self):
            self.another_variable = 'another value'

.. sourcecode:: java

    public class StaticJavaExample {
        public static String variable = "value";
        public static String[] LIST__list = {1, 2, 3};
        private String notVariable = "is private";
        public String anotherVariable;

        public StaticJavaExample() {
            anotherVariable = "another value";
        }
    }

The second examples utilizes dynamic approach for getting variables. Both of
them create only one variable `${DYNAMIC VARIABLE}`.

.. sourcecode:: python

    class DynamicPythonExample(object):

        def get_variables(self, *args):
            return {'dynamic variable': ' '.join(args)}

.. sourcecode:: java

    import java.util.Map;
    import java.util.HashMap;

    public class DynamicJavaExample {

        public Map<String, String> getVariables(String arg1, String arg2) {
            HashMap<String, String> variables = new HashMap<String, String>();
            variables.put("dynamic variable", arg1 + " " + arg2);
            return variables;
        }
    }

Variable file as YAML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variable files can also be implemented as `YAML <http://yaml.org>`_ files.
YAML is a data serialization language with a simple and human-friendly syntax.
The following example demonstrates a simple YAML file:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    string:   Hello, world!
    integer:  42
    list:
      - one
      - two
    dict:
      one: yksi
      two: kaksi
      with spaces: kolme

.. note:: Using YAML files with Robot Framework requires `PyYAML
          <http://pyyaml.org>`_ module to be installed. If you have
          pip_ installed, you can install it simply by running
          `pip install pyyaml`.

          YAML variable files must have either :file:`.yaml` or :file:`.yml`
          extension. Support for the :file:`.yml` extension is new in
          Robot Framework 3.2.

YAML variable files can be used exactly like normal variable files
from the command line using :option:`--variablefile` option, in the settings
table using :setting:`Variables` setting, and dynamically using the
:name:`Import Variables` keyword.

If the above YAML file is imported, it will create exactly the same
variables as the following variable table:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Variables ***
   ${STRING}     Hello, world!
   ${INTEGER}    ${42}
   @{LIST}       one         two
   &{DICT}       one=yksi    two=kaksi

YAML files used as variable files must always be mappings in the top level.
As the above example demonstrates, keys and values in the mapping become
variable names and values, respectively. Variable values can be any data
types supported by YAML syntax. If names or values contain non-ASCII
characters, YAML variables files must be UTF-8 encoded.

Mappings used as values are automatically converted to special dictionaries
that are used also when `creating dictionary variables`_ in the variable table.
Most importantly, values of these dictionaries are accessible as attributes
like `${DICT.one}`, assuming their names are valid as Python attribute names.
If the name contains spaces or is otherwise not a valid attribute name, it is
always possible to access dictionary values using syntax like
`${DICT}[with spaces]` syntax. The created dictionaries are also ordered, but
unfortunately the original source order of in the YAML file is not preserved.
