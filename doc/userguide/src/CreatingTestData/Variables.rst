Introduction
------------

Variables are an integral feature of Robot Framework, and they can be
used in most places in test data. Most commonly, they are used in
arguments for keywords in test case tables and keyword tables, but
also all settings allow variables in their values. A normal keyword
name *cannot* be specified with a variable, but the BuiltIn_ keyword
:name:`Run Keyword` can be used to get the same effect.

Robot Framework has its own variables that can be used as scalars__, lists__
or `dictionaries`__ using syntax `${SCALAR}`, `@{LIST}` and `&{DICT}`,
respectively. In addition to this, `environment variables`_ can be used
directly with syntax `%{ENV_VAR}`.

Variables are useful, for example, in these cases:

- When strings change often in the test data. With variables you only
  need to make these changes in one place.

- When creating system-independent and operating-system-independent test
  data. Using variables instead of hard-coded strings eases that considerably
  (for example, `${RESOURCES}` instead of `c:\resources`, or `${HOST}`
  instead of `10.0.0.1:8080`). Because variables can be `set from the
  command line`__ when tests are started, changing system-specific
  variables is easy (for example, `--variable HOST:10.0.0.2:1234
  --variable RESOURCES:/opt/resources`). This also facilitates
  localization testing, which often involves running the same tests
  with different strings.

- When there is a need to have objects other than strings as arguments
  for keywords. This is not possible without variables.

- When different keywords, even in different test libraries, need to
  communicate. You can assign a return value from one keyword to a
  variable and pass it as an argument to another.

- When values in the test data are long or otherwise complicated. For
  example, `${URL}` is shorter than
  `http://long.domain.name:8080/path/to/service?foo=1&bar=2&zap=42`.

If a non-existent variable is used in the test data, the keyword using
it fails. If the same syntax that is used for variables is needed as a
literal string, it must be `escaped with a backslash`__ as in `\${NAME}`.

Using variables
---------------

This section explains how to use variables, including the normal scalar
variable syntax `${var}`, how to use variables in list and dictionary
contexts like `@{var}` and `&{var}`, respectively, and how to use environment
variables like `%{var}`. Different ways how to create variables are discussed
in the subsequent sections.

Robot Framework variables, similarly as keywords, are
case-insensitive, and also spaces and underscores are
ignored. However, it is recommended to use capital letters with
global variables (for example, `${PATH}` or `${TWO WORDS}`)
and small letters with local variables that are only available in certain
test cases or user keywords (for example, `${my var}`). Much more
importantly, though, case should be used consistently.

Variable name consists of the variable type identifier (`$`, `@`, `&`, `%`),
curly braces (`{`, `}`) and the actual variable name between the braces.
Unlike in some programming languages where similar variable syntax is
used, curly braces are always mandatory. Variable names can basically have
any characters between the curly braces. However, using only alphabetic
characters from a to z, numbers, underscore and space is recommended, and
it is even a requirement for using the `extended variable syntax`_.

.. _scalar variable:
.. _scalar variables:

Scalar variable syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common way to use variables in Robot Framework test data is using
the scalar variable syntax like `${var}`. When this syntax is used, the
variable name is replaced with its value as-is. Most of the time variable
values are strings, but variables can contain any object, including numbers,
lists, dictionaries, or even custom objects.

The example below illustrates the usage of scalar variables. Assuming
that the variables `${GREET}` and `${NAME}` are available
and assigned to strings `Hello` and `world`, respectively,
both the example test cases are equivalent.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Constants
       Log    Hello
       Log    Hello, world!!

   Variables
       Log    ${GREET}
       Log    ${GREET}, ${NAME}!!

When a scalar variable is used alone without any text or other variables
around it, like in `${GREET}` above, the variable is replaced with
its value as-is and the value can be any object. If the variable is not used
alone, like `${GREER}, ${NAME}!!` above, its value is first converted into
a string and then concatenated with the other data.

.. note:: Variable values are used as-is without conversions also when
          passing arguments to keywords using the `named arguments`_
          syntax like `argname=${var}`.

The example below demonstrates the difference between having a
variable in alone or with other content. First, let us assume
that we have a variable `${STR}` set to a string `Hello,
world!` and `${OBJ}` set to an instance of the following Java
object:

.. sourcecode:: java

 public class MyObj {

     public String toString() {
         return "Hi, terra!";
     }
 }

With these two variables set, we then have the following test data:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Objects
       KW 1    ${STR}
       KW 2    ${OBJ}
       KW 3    I said "${STR}"
       KW 4    You said "${OBJ}"

Finally, when this test data is executed, different keywords receive
the arguments as explained below:

- :name:`KW 1` gets a string `Hello, world!`
- :name:`KW 2` gets an object stored to variable `${OBJ}`
- :name:`KW 3` gets a string `I said "Hello, world!"`
- :name:`KW 4` gets a string `You said "Hi, terra!"`

.. Note:: Converting variables to Unicode obviously fails if the variable
          cannot be represented as Unicode. This can happen, for example,
          if you try to use byte sequences as arguments to keywords so that
          you catenate the values together like `${byte1}${byte2}`.
          A workaround is creating a variable that contains the whole value
          and using it alone in the cell (e.g. `${bytes}`) because then
          the value is used as-is.

.. _list variable:
.. _list variables:
.. _list expansion:

List variable syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a variable is used as a scalar like `${EXAMPLE}`, its value is be
used as-is. If a variable value is a list or list-like, it is also possible
to use it as a list variable like `@{EXAMPLE}`. In this case the list is expanded
and individual items are passed in as separate arguments. This is easiest to explain
with an example. Assuming that a variable `@{USER}` has value `['robot', 'secret']`,
the following two test cases are equivalent:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Constants
       Login    robot    secret

   List Variable
       Login    @{USER}

Robot Framework stores its own variables in one internal storage and allows
using them as scalars, lists or dictionaries. Using a variable as a list
requires its value to be a Python list or list-like object. Robot Framework
does not allow strings to be used as lists, but other iterable objects such
as tuples or dictionaries are accepted.

Starting from Robot Framework 4.0, list expansion can be used in combination with
`list item access`__ making these usages possible:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Nested container
       ${nested} =    Evaluate    [['a', 'b', 'c'], {'key': ['x', 'y']}]
       Log Many    @{nested}[0]         # Logs 'a', 'b' and 'c'.
       Log Many    @{nested}[1][key]    # Logs 'x' and 'y'.

   Slice
       ${items} =    Create List    first    second    third
       Log Many    @{items}[1:]         # Logs 'second' and  'third'.

__ `Accessing sequence items`_

Using list variables with other data
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

It is possible to use list variables with other arguments, including
other list variables.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       Keyword    @{LIST}    more    args
       Keyword    ${SCALAR}    @{LIST}    constant
       Keyword    @{LIST}    @{ANOTHER}    @{ONE MORE}

Using list variables with settings
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

List variables can be used only with some of the settings__. They can
be used in arguments to imported libraries and variable files, but
library and variable file names themselves cannot be list
variables. Also with setups and teardowns list variable can not be used
as the name of the keyword, but can be used in arguments. With tag related
settings they can be used freely. Using scalar variables is possible in
those places where list variables are not supported.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Settings ***
   Library         ExampleLibrary      @{LIB ARGS}    # This works
   Library         ${LIBRARY}          @{LIB ARGS}    # This works
   Library         @{LIBRARY AND ARGS}                # This does not work
   Suite Setup     Some Keyword        @{KW ARGS}     # This works
   Suite Setup     ${KEYWORD}          @{KW ARGS}     # This works
   Suite Setup     @{KEYWORD AND ARGS}                # This does not work
   Default Tags    @{TAGS}                            # This works

__ `All available settings in test data`_

.. _dictionary variable:
.. _dictionary variables:
.. _dictionary expansion:

Dictionary variable syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As discussed above, a variable containing a list can be used as a `list
variable`_ to pass list items to a keyword as individual arguments.
Similarly a variable containing a Python dictionary or a dictionary-like
object can be used as a dictionary variable like `&{EXAMPLE}`. In practice
this means that the dictionary is expanded and individual items are passed as
`named arguments`_ to the keyword. Assuming that a variable `&{USER}` has
value `{'name': 'robot', 'password': 'secret'}`, the following two test cases
are equivalent.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Constants
       Login    name=robot    password=secret

   Dict Variable
       Login    &{USER}

Starting from Robot Framework 4.0, dictionary expansion can be used in combination with
`dictionary item access`__ making usages like `&{nested}[key]` possible.

__ `Accessing individual dictionary items`_

Using dictionary variables with other data
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

It is possible to use dictionary variables with other arguments, including
other dictionary variables. Because `named argument syntax`_ requires positional
arguments to be before named argument, dictionaries can only be followed by
named arguments or other dictionaries.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       Keyword    &{DICT}    named=arg
       Keyword    positional    @{LIST}    &{DICT}
       Keyword    &{DICT}    &{ANOTHER}    &{ONE MORE}

Using dictionary variables with settings
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Dictionary variables cannot generally be used with settings. The only exception
are imports, setups and teardowns where dictionaries can be used as arguments.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Settings ***
   Library        ExampleLibrary    &{LIB ARGS}
   Suite Setup    Some Keyword      &{KW ARGS}     named=arg

.. _environment variable:

Accessing list and dictionary items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to access items of subscriptable variables, e.g. lists and dictionaries,
using special syntax like `${var}[item]` or `${var}[nested][item]`.
Starting from Robot Framework 4.0, it is also possible to use item access together with
`list expansion`_ and `dictionary expansion`_ by using syntax `@{var}[item]` and
`&{var}[item]`, respectively.

.. note:: Prior to Robot Framework 3.1 the normal item access syntax was  `@{var}[item]`
          with lists and `&{var}[item]` with dictionaries. Robot Framework 3.1 introduced
          the generic `${var}[item]` syntax along with some other nice enhancements and
          the old item access syntax was deprecated in Robot Framework 3.2.

.. _sequence items:

Accessing sequence items
''''''''''''''''''''''''

It is possible to access a certain item of a variable containing a `sequence`__
(e.g. list, string or bytes) with the syntax `${var}[index]`, where `index`
is the index of the selected value. Indices start from zero, negative indices
can be used to access items from the end, and trying to access an item with
too large an index causes an error. Indices are automatically converted to
integers, and it is also possible to use variables as indices.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Positive index
       Login    ${USER}[0]    ${USER}[1]
       Title Should Be    Welcome ${USER}[0]!

   Negative index
       Keyword    ${SEQUENCE}[-1]

   Index defined as variable
       Keyword    ${SEQUENCE}[${INDEX}]

Sequence item access supports also the `same "slice" functionality as Python`__
with syntax like `${var}[1:]`. With this syntax you do not get a single
item but a slice of the original sequence. Same way as with Python you can
specify the start index, the end index, and the step:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Start index
       Keyword    ${SEQUENCE}[1:]

   End index
       Keyword    ${SEQUENCE}[:4]

   Start and end
       Keyword    ${SEQUENCE}[2:-1]

   Step
       Keyword    ${SEQUENCE}[::2]
       Keyword    ${SEQUENCE}[1:-1:10]

.. note:: The slice syntax is new in Robot Framework 3.1. It was extended to work
          with `list expansion`_ like `@{var}[1:]` in Robot Framework 4.0.

.. note:: Prior to Robot Framework 3.2, item and slice access was only supported
          with variables containing lists, tuples, or other objects considered
          list-like. Nowadays all sequences, including strings and bytes, are
          supported.

__ https://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-slice

.. _dictionary items:

Accessing individual dictionary items
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

It is possible to access a certain value of a dictionary variable
with the syntax `${NAME}[key]`, where `key` is the name of the
selected value. Keys are considered to be strings, but non-strings
keys can be used as variables. Dictionary values accessed in this
manner can be used similarly as scalar variables.

If a key is a string, it is possible to access its value also using
attribute access syntax `${NAME.key}`. See `Creating dictionary variables`_
for more details about this syntax.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Dictionary variable item
       Login    ${USER}[name]    ${USER}[password]
       Title Should Be    Welcome ${USER}[name]!

   Key defined as variable
       Log Many    ${DICT}[${KEY}]    ${DICT}[${42}]

   Attribute access
       Login    ${USER.name}    ${USER.password}
       Title Should Be    Welcome ${USER.name}!

Nested item access
''''''''''''''''''

Also nested subscriptable variables can be accessed using the same
item access syntax like `${var}[item1][item2]`. This is especially useful
when working with JSON data often returned by REST services. For example,
if a variable `${DATA}` contains `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Robot'},
{'id': 2, 'name': 'Mr. X'}]`, this tests would pass:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Nested item access
       Should Be Equal    ${DATA}[0][name]    Robot
       Should Be Equal    ${DATA}[1][id]      ${2}

Environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework allows using environment variables in the test data using
the syntax `%{ENV_VAR_NAME}`. They are limited to string values. It is
possible to specify a default value, that is used if the environment
variable does not exists, by separating the variable name and the default
value with an equal sign like `%{ENV_VAR_NAME=default value}`.

Environment variables set in the operating system before the test execution are
available during it, and it is possible to create new ones with the keyword
:name:`Set Environment Variable` or delete existing ones with the
keyword :name:`Delete Environment Variable`, both available in the
OperatingSystem_ library. Because environment variables are global,
environment variables set in one test case can be used in other test
cases executed after it. However, changes to environment variables are
not effective after the test execution.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Environment variables
       Log    Current user: %{USER}
       Run    %{JAVA_HOME}${/}javac

   Environment variables with defaults
       Set port    %{APPLICATION_PORT=8080}

.. note:: Support for specifying the default value is new in Robot Framework 3.2.

Java system properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running tests with Jython, it is possible to access `Java system properties`__
using same syntax as `environment variables`_. If an environment variable and a
system property with same name exist, the environment variable will be used.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   System properties
       Log    %{user.name} running tests on %{os.name}
       Log    %{custom.property=default value}

__ http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html

Creating variables
------------------

Variables can spring into existence from different sources.

Variable table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common source for variables are Variable tables in `test case
files`_ and `resource files`_. Variable tables are convenient, because they
allow creating variables in the same place as the rest of the test
data, and the needed syntax is very simple. Their main disadvantages are
that values are always strings and they cannot be created dynamically.
If either of these is a problem, `variable files`_ can be used instead.

Creating scalar variables
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

The simplest possible variable assignment is setting a string into a
scalar variable. This is done by giving the variable name (including
`${}`) in the first column of the Variable table and the value in
the second one. If the second column is empty, an empty string is set
as a value. Also an already defined variable can be used in the value.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Variables ***
   ${NAME}         Robot Framework
   ${VERSION}      2.0
   ${ROBOT}        ${NAME} ${VERSION}

It is also possible, but not obligatory,
to use the equals sign `=` after the variable name to make assigning
variables slightly more explicit.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Variables ***
   ${NAME} =       Robot Framework
   ${VERSION} =    2.0

If a scalar variable has a long value, it can be split to multiple columns and
rows__. By default cells are catenated together using a space, but this
can be changed by having `SEPARATOR=<sep>` in the first cell.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Variables ***
   ${EXAMPLE}      This value is joined    together with a space
   ${MULTILINE}    SEPARATOR=\n    First line
   ...             Second line     Third line

__ `Dividing data to several rows`_

Creating list variables
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Creating list variables is as easy as creating scalar variables. Again, the
variable name is in the first column of the Variable table and
values in the subsequent columns. A list variable can have any number
of values, starting from zero, and if many values are needed, they
can be `split into several rows`__.

__ `Dividing data to several rows`_

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Variables ***
   @{NAMES}        Matti       Teppo
   @{NAMES2}       @{NAMES}    Seppo
   @{NOTHING}
   @{MANY}         one         two      three      four
   ...             five        six      seven

Creating dictionary variables
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Dictionary variables can be created in the variable table similarly as
list variables. The difference is that items need to be created using
`name=value` syntax or existing dictionary variables. If there are multiple
items with same name, the last value has precedence. If a name contains
a literal equal sign, it can be escaped__ with a backslash like `\=`.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Variables ***
   &{USER 1}       name=Matti    address=xxx         phone=123
   &{USER 2}       name=Teppo    address=yyy         phone=456
   &{MANY}         first=1       second=${2}         ${3}=third
   &{EVEN MORE}    &{MANY}       first=override      empty=
   ...             =empty        key\=here=value

Dictionary variables have two extra properties
compared to normal Python dictionaries. First of all, values of these
dictionaries can be accessed like attributes, which means that it is possible
to use `extended variable syntax`_ like `${VAR.key}`. This only works if the
key is a valid attribute name and does not match any normal attribute
Python dictionaries have. For example, individual value `&{USER}[name]` can
also be accessed like `${USER.name}` (notice that `$` is needed in this
context), but using `${MANY.3}` is not possible.

.. note:: Starting from Robot Framework 3.0.3, dictionary variable keys are
          accessible recursively like `${VAR.nested.key}`. This eases working
          with nested data structures.

Another special property of dictionary variables is
that they are ordered. This means that if these dictionaries are iterated,
their items always come in the order they are defined. This can be useful
if dictionaries are used as `list variables`_ with `for loops`_ or otherwise.
When a dictionary is used as a list variable, the actual value contains
dictionary keys. For example, `@{MANY}` variable would have value `['first',
'second', 3]`.

__ Escaping_

Variable file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variable files are the most powerful mechanism for creating different
kind of variables. It is possible to assign variables to any object
using them, and they also enable creating variables dynamically. The
variable file syntax and taking variable files into use is explained
in section `Resource and variable files`_.

Setting variables in command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables can be set from the command line either individually with
the :option:`--variable (-v)` option or using a variable file with the
:option:`--variablefile (-V)` option. Variables set from the command line
are globally available for all executed test data files, and they also
override possible variables with the same names in the Variable table and in
variable files imported in the test data.

The syntax for setting individual variables is :option:`--variable
name:value`, where `name` is the name of the variable without
`${}` and `value` is its value. Several variables can be
set by using this option several times. Only scalar variables can be
set using this syntax and they can only get string values.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   --variable EXAMPLE:value
   --variable HOST:localhost:7272 --variable USER:robot

In the examples above, variables are set so that

- `${EXAMPLE}` gets the value `value`
- `${HOST}` and `${USER}` get the values
  `localhost:7272` and `robot`

The basic syntax for taking `variable files`_ into use from the command line
is :option:`--variablefile path/to/variables.py`, and `Taking variable files into
use`_ section has more details. What variables actually are created depends on
what variables there are in the referenced variable file.

If both variable files and individual variables are given from the command line,
the latter have `higher priority`__.

__ `Variable priorities and scopes`_

Return values from keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Return values from keywords can also be set into variables. This
allows communication between different keywords even in different test
libraries.

Variables set in this manner are otherwise similar to any other
variables, but they are available only in the `local scope`_
where they are created. Thus it is not possible, for example, to set
a variable like this in one test case and use it in another. This is
because, in general, automated test cases should not depend on each
other, and accidentally setting a variable that is used elsewhere
could cause hard-to-debug errors. If there is a genuine need for
setting a variable in one test case and using it in another, it is
possible to use BuiltIn_ keywords as explained in the next section.

Assigning scalar variables
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Any value returned by a keyword can be assigned to a `scalar variable`_.
As illustrated by the example below, the required syntax is very simple:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Returning
       ${x} =    Get X    an argument
       Log    We got ${x}!

In the above example the value returned by the :name:`Get X` keyword
is first set into the variable `${x}` and then used by the :name:`Log`
keyword. Having the equals sign `=` after the variable name is
not obligatory, but it makes the assignment more explicit. Creating
local variables like this works both in test case and user keyword level.

Notice that although a value is assigned to a scalar variable, it can
be used as a `list variable`_ if it has a list-like value and as a `dictionary
variable`_ if it has a dictionary-like value.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       ${list} =    Create List    first    second    third
       Length Should Be    ${list}    3
       Log Many    @{list}

Assigning list variables
''''''''''''''''''''''''

If a keyword returns a list or any list-like object, it is possible to
assign it to a `list variable`_:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       @{list} =    Create List    first    second    third
       Length Should Be    ${list}    3
       Log Many    @{list}

Because all Robot Framework variables are stored in the same namespace, there is
not much difference between assigning a value to a scalar variable or a list
variable. This can be seen by comparing the last two examples above. The main
differences are that when creating a list variable, Robot Framework
automatically verifies that the value is a list or list-like, and the stored
variable value will be a new list created from the return value. When
assigning to a scalar variable, the return value is not verified and the
stored value will be the exact same object that was returned.

Assigning dictionary variables
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If a keyword returns a dictionary or any dictionary-like object, it is possible
to assign it to a `dictionary variable`_:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       &{dict} =    Create Dictionary    first=1    second=${2}    ${3}=third
       Length Should Be    ${dict}    3
       Do Something    &{dict}
       Log    ${dict.first}

Because all Robot Framework variables are stored in the same namespace, it would
also be possible to assign a dictionary into a scalar variable and use it
later as a dictionary when needed. There are, however, some actual benefits
in creating a dictionary variable explicitly. First of all, Robot Framework
verifies that the returned value is a dictionary or dictionary-like similarly
as it verifies that list variables can only get a list-like value.

A bigger benefit is that the value is converted into a special dictionary
that it uses also when `creating dictionary variables`_ in the variable table.
Values in these dictionaries can be accessed using attribute access like
`${dict.first}` in the above example. These dictionaries are also ordered, but
if the original dictionary was not ordered, the resulting order is arbitrary.

Assigning multiple variables
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If a keyword returns a list or a list-like object, it is possible to assign
individual values into multiple scalar variables or into scalar variables and
a list variable.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Assign multiple
       ${a}    ${b}    ${c} =    Get Three
       ${first}    @{rest} =    Get Three
       @{before}    ${last} =    Get Three
       ${begin}    @{middle}    ${end} =    Get Three

Assuming that the keyword :name:`Get Three` returns a list `[1, 2, 3]`,
the following variables are created:

- `${a}`, `${b}` and `${c}` with values `1`, `2`, and `3`, respectively.
- `${first}` with value `1`, and `@{rest}` with value `[2, 3]`.
- `@{before}` with value `[1, 2]` and `${last}` with value `3`.
- `${begin}` with value `1`, `@{middle}` with value `[2]` and ${end} with
  value `3`.

It is an error if the returned list has more or less values than there are
scalar variables to assign. Additionally, only one list variable is allowed
and dictionary variables can only be assigned alone.

Using :name:`Set Test/Suite/Global Variable` keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The BuiltIn_ library has keywords :name:`Set Test Variable`,
:name:`Set Suite Variable` and :name:`Set Global Variable` which can
be used for setting variables dynamically during the test
execution. If a variable already exists within the new scope, its
value will be overwritten, and otherwise a new variable is created.

Variables set with :name:`Set Test Variable` keyword are available
everywhere within the scope of the currently executed test case. For
example, if you set a variable in a user keyword, it is available both
in the test case level and also in all other user keywords used in the
current test. Other test cases will not see variables set with this
keyword.

Variables set with :name:`Set Suite Variable` keyword are available
everywhere within the scope of the currently executed test
suite. Setting variables with this keyword thus has the same effect as
creating them using the `Variable table`_ in the test data file or
importing them from `variable files`_. Other test suites, including
possible child test suites, will not see variables set with this
keyword.

Variables set with :name:`Set Global Variable` keyword are globally
available in all test cases and suites executed after setting
them. Setting variables with this keyword thus has the same effect as
`creating from the command line`__ using the options :option:`--variable` or
:option:`--variablefile`. Because this keyword can change variables
everywhere, it should be used with care.

.. note:: :name:`Set Test/Suite/Global Variable` keywords set named
          variables directly into `test, suite or global variable scope`__
          and return nothing. On the other hand, another BuiltIn_ keyword
          :name:`Set Variable` sets local variables using `return values`__.

Built-in variables
------------------

Robot Framework provides some built-in variables that are available
automatically.

Operating-system variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Built-in variables related to the operating system ease making the test data
operating-system-agnostic.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       Create Binary File    ${CURDIR}${/}input.data    Some text here${\n}on two lines
       Set Environment Variable    CLASSPATH    ${TEMPDIR}${:}${CURDIR}${/}foo.jar

Number variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The variable syntax can be used for creating both integers and
floating point numbers, as illustrated in the example below. This is
useful when a keyword expects to get an actual number, and not a
string that just looks like a number, as an argument.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example 1A
       Connect    example.com    80       # Connect gets two strings as arguments

   Example 1B
       Connect    example.com    ${80}    # Connect gets a string and an integer

   Example 2
       Do X    ${3.14}    ${-1e-4}        # Do X gets floating point numbers 3.14 and -0.0001

It is possible to create integers also from binary, octal, and
hexadecimal values using `0b`, `0o` and `0x` prefixes, respectively.
The syntax is case insensitive.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       Should Be Equal    ${0b1011}    ${11}
       Should Be Equal    ${0o10}      ${8}
       Should Be Equal    ${0xff}      ${255}
       Should Be Equal    ${0B1010}    ${0XA}

Boolean and None/null variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also Boolean values and Python `None` and Java `null` can
be created using the variable syntax similarly as numbers.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Boolean
       Set Status    ${true}               # Set Status gets Boolean true as an argument
       Create Y    something   ${false}    # Create Y gets a string and Boolean false

   None
       Do XYZ    ${None}                   # Do XYZ gets Python None as an argument

   Null
       ${ret} =    Get Value    arg        # Checking that Get Value returns Java null
       Should Be Equal    ${ret}    ${null}

These variables are case-insensitive, so for example `${True}` and
`${true}` are equivalent. Additionally, `${None}` and
`${null}` are synonyms, because when running tests on the Jython
interpreter, Jython automatically converts `None` and
`null` to the correct format when necessary.

Space and empty variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to create spaces and empty strings using variables
`${SPACE}` and `${EMPTY}`, respectively. These variables are
useful, for example, when there would otherwise be a need to `escape
spaces or empty cells`__ with a backslash. If more than one space is
needed, it is possible to use the `extended variable syntax`_ like
`${SPACE * 5}`.  In the following example, :name:`Should Be
Equal` keyword gets identical arguments but those using variables are
easier to understand than those using backslashes.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   One space
       Should Be Equal    ${SPACE}          \ \

   Four spaces
       Should Be Equal    ${SPACE * 4}      \ \ \ \ \

   Ten spaces
       Should Be Equal    ${SPACE * 10}     \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

   Quoted space
       Should Be Equal    "${SPACE}"        " "

   Quoted spaces
       Should Be Equal    "${SPACE * 2}"    " \ "

   Empty
       Should Be Equal    ${EMPTY}          \

There is also an empty `list variable`_ `@{EMPTY}` and an empty `dictionary
variable`_ `&{EMPTY}`. Because they have no content, they basically
vanish when used somewhere in the test data. They are useful, for example,
with `test templates`_ when the `template keyword is used without
arguments`__ or when overriding list or dictionary variables in different
scopes. Modifying the value of `@{EMPTY}` or `&{EMPTY}` is not possible.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Template
       [Template]    Some keyword
       @{EMPTY}

   Override
       Set Global Variable    @{LIST}    @{EMPTY}
       Set Suite Variable     &{DICT}    &{EMPTY}

.. note:: `${SPACE}` represents the ASCII space (`\x20`) and `other spaces`__
          should be specified using the `escape sequences`__ like `\xA0`
          (NO-BREAK SPACE) and `\u3000` (IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE).

Automatic variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some automatic variables can also be used in the test data. These
variables can have different values during the test execution and some
of them are not even available all the time. Altering the value of
these variables does not affect the original values, but some values
can be changed dynamically using keywords from the `BuiltIn`_ library.

Suite related variables `${SUITE SOURCE}`, `${SUITE NAME}`,
`${SUITE DOCUMENTATION}` and `&{SUITE METADATA}` are
available already when test libraries and variable files are imported.
Possible variables in these automatic variables are not yet resolved
at the import time, though.

Variable priorities and scopes
------------------------------

Variables coming from different sources have different priorities and
are available in different scopes.

Variable priorities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Variables from the command line*

   Variables `set in the command line`__ have the highest priority of all
   variables that can be set before the actual test execution starts. They
   override possible variables created in Variable tables in test case
   files, as well as in resource and variable files imported in the
   test data.

   Individually set variables (:option:`--variable` option) override the
   variables set using `variable files`_ (:option:`--variablefile` option).
   If you specify same individual variable multiple times, the one specified
   last will override earlier ones. This allows setting default values for
   variables in a `start-up script`_ and overriding them from the command line.
   Notice, though, that if multiple variable files have same variables, the
   ones in the file specified first have the highest priority.

__ `Setting variables in command line`_

*Variable table in a test case file*

   Variables created using the `Variable table`_ in a test case file
   are available for all the test cases in that file. These variables
   override possible variables with same names in imported resource and
   variable files.

   Variables created in the variable tables are available in all other tables
   in the file where they are created. This means that they can be used also
   in the Setting table, for example, for importing more variables from
   resource and variable files.

*Imported resource and variable files*

   Variables imported from the `resource and variable files`_ have the
   lowest priority of all variables created in the test data.
   Variables from resource files and variable files have the same
   priority. If several resource and/or variable file have same
   variables, the ones in the file imported first are taken into use.

   If a resource file imports resource files or variable files,
   variables in its own Variable table have a higher priority than
   variables it imports. All these variables are available for files that
   import this resource file.

   Note that variables imported from resource and variable files are not
   available in the Variable table of the file that imports them. This
   is due to the Variable table being processed before the Setting table
   where the resource files and variable files are imported.

*Variables set during test execution*

   Variables set during the test execution either using `return values
   from keywords`_ or `using Set Test/Suite/Global Variable keywords`_
   always override possible existing
   variables in the scope where they are set. In a sense they thus
   have the highest priority, but on the other hand they do not affect
   variables outside the scope they are defined.

*Built-in variables*

   `Built-in variables`_ like `${TEMPDIR}` and `${TEST_NAME}`
   have the highest priority of all variables. They cannot be overridden
   using Variable table or from command line, but even they can be reset during
   the test execution. An exception to this rule are `number variables`_, which
   are resolved dynamically if no variable is found otherwise. They can thus be
   overridden, but that is generally a bad idea. Additionally `${CURDIR}`
   is special because it is replaced already during the test data processing time.

Variable scopes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on where and how they are created, variables can have a
global, test suite, test case or local scope.

Global scope
''''''''''''

Global variables are available everywhere in the test data. These
variables are normally `set from the command line`__ with the
:option:`--variable` and :option:`--variablefile` options, but it is also
possible to create new global variables or change the existing ones
with the BuiltIn_ keyword :name:`Set Global Variable` anywhere in
the test data. Additionally also `built-in variables`_ are global.

It is recommended to use capital letters with all global variables.

Test suite scope
''''''''''''''''

Variables with the test suite scope are available anywhere in the
test suite where they are defined or imported. They can be created
in Variable tables, imported from `resource and variable files`_,
or set during the test execution using the BuiltIn_ keyword
:name:`Set Suite Variable`.

The test suite scope *is not recursive*, which means that variables
available in a higher-level test suite *are not available* in
lower-level suites. If necessary, `resource and variable files`_ can
be used for sharing variables.

Since these variables can be considered global in the test suite where
they are used, it is recommended to use capital letters also with them.

Test case scope
'''''''''''''''

Variables with the test case scope are visible in a test case and in
all user keywords the test uses. Initially there are no variables in
this scope, but it is possible to create them by using the BuiltIn_
keyword :name:`Set Test Variable` anywhere in a test case.

Also variables in the test case scope are to some extend global. It is
thus generally recommended to use capital letters with them too.

Local scope
'''''''''''

Test cases and user keywords have a local variable scope that is not
seen by other tests or keywords. Local variables can be created using
`return values`__ from executed keywords and user keywords also get
them as arguments__.

It is recommended to use lower-case letters with local variables.

__ `Return values from keywords`_
__ `User keyword arguments`_

Advanced variable features
--------------------------

Extended variable syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extended variable syntax allows accessing attributes of an object assigned
to a variable (for example, `${object.attribute}`) and even calling
its methods (for example, `${obj.getName()}`). It works both with
scalar and list variables, but is mainly useful with the former

Extended variable syntax is a powerful feature, but it should
be used with care. Accessing attributes is normally not a problem, on
the contrary, because one variable containing an object with several
attributes is often better than having several variables. On the
other hand, calling methods, especially when they are used with
arguments, can make the test data pretty complicated to understand.
If that happens, it is recommended to move the code into a test library.

The most common usages of extended variable syntax are illustrated
in the example below. First assume that we have the following `variable file`_
and test case:

.. sourcecode:: python

   class MyObject:

       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def eat(self, what):
           return '%s eats %s' % (self.name, what)

       def __str__(self):
           return self.name

   OBJECT = MyObject('Robot')
   DICTIONARY = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       KW 1    ${OBJECT.name}
       KW 2    ${OBJECT.eat('Cucumber')}
       KW 3    ${DICTIONARY[2]}

When this test data is executed, the keywords get the arguments as
explained below:

- :name:`KW 1` gets string `Robot`
- :name:`KW 2` gets string `Robot eats Cucumber`
- :name:`KW 3` gets string `two`

The extended variable syntax is evaluated in the following order:

1. The variable is searched using the full variable name. The extended
   variable syntax is evaluated only if no matching variable
   is found.

2. The name of the base variable is created. The body of the name
   consists of all the characters after the opening `{` until
   the first occurrence of a character that is not an alphanumeric character
   or a space. For example, base variables of `${OBJECT.name}`
   and `${DICTIONARY[2]}`) are `OBJECT` and `DICTIONARY`,
   respectively.

3. A variable matching the body is searched. If there is no match, an
   exception is raised and the test case fails.

4. The expression inside the curly brackets is evaluated as a Python
   expression, so that the base variable name is replaced with its
   value. If the evaluation fails because of an invalid syntax or that
   the queried attribute does not exist, an exception is raised and
   the test fails.

5. The whole extended variable is replaced with the value returned
   from the evaluation.

If the object that is used is implemented with Java, the extended
variable syntax allows you to access attributes using so-called bean
properties. In essence, this means that if you have an object with the
`getName`  method set into a variable `${OBJ}`, then the
syntax `${OBJ.name}` is equivalent to but clearer than
`${OBJ.getName()}`. The Python object used in the previous example
could thus be replaced with the following Java implementation:

.. sourcecode:: java

 public class MyObject:

     private String name;

     public MyObject(String name) {
         name = name;
     }

     public String getName() {
         return name;
     }

     public String eat(String what) {
         return name + " eats " + what;
     }

     public String toString() {
         return name;
     }
 }

Many standard Python objects, including strings and numbers, have
methods that can be used with the extended variable syntax either
explicitly or implicitly. Sometimes this can be really useful and
reduce the need for setting temporary variables, but it is also easy
to overuse it and create really cryptic test data. Following examples
show few pretty good usages.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   String
       ${string} =    Set Variable    abc
       Log    ${string.upper()}      # Logs 'ABC'
       Log    ${string * 2}          # Logs 'abcabc'

   Number
       ${number} =    Set Variable    ${-2}
       Log    ${number * 10}         # Logs -20
       Log    ${number.__abs__()}    # Logs 2

Note that even though `abs(number)` is recommended over
`number.__abs__()` in normal Python code, using
`${abs(number)}` does not work. This is because the variable name
must be in the beginning of the extended syntax. Using `__xxx__`
methods in the test data like this is already a bit questionable, and
it is normally better to move this kind of logic into test libraries.

Extended variable syntax works also in `list variable`_ context.
If, for example, an object assigned to a variable `${EXTENDED}` has
an attribute `attribute` that contains a list as a value, it can be
used as a list variable `@{EXTENDED.attribute}`.

Extended variable assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to set attributes of
objects stored to scalar variables using `keyword return values`__ and
a variation of the `extended variable syntax`_. Assuming we have
variable `${OBJECT}` from the previous examples, attributes could
be set to it like in the example below.

__ `Return values from keywords`_

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       ${OBJECT.name} =    Set Variable    New name
       ${OBJECT.new_attr} =    Set Variable    New attribute

The extended variable assignment syntax is evaluated using the
following rules:

1. The assigned variable must be a scalar variable and have at least
   one dot. Otherwise the extended assignment syntax is not used and
   the variable is assigned normally.

2. If there exists a variable with the full name
   (e.g. `${OBJECT.name}` in the example above) that variable
   will be assigned a new value and the extended syntax is not used.

3. The name of the base variable is created. The body of the name
   consists of all the characters between the opening `${` and
   the last dot, for example, `OBJECT` in `${OBJECT.name}`
   and `foo.bar` in `${foo.bar.zap}`. As the second example
   illustrates, the base name may contain normal extended variable
   syntax.

4. The name of the attribute to set is created by taking all the
   characters between the last dot and the closing `}`, for
   example, `name` in `${OBJECT.name}`. If the name does not
   start with a letter or underscore and contain only these characters
   and numbers, the attribute is considered invalid and the extended
   syntax is not used. A new variable with the full name is created
   instead.

5. A variable matching the base name is searched. If no variable is
   found, the extended syntax is not used and, instead, a new variable
   is created using the full variable name.

6. If the found variable is a string or a number, the extended syntax
   is ignored and a new variable created using the full name. This is
   done because you cannot add new attributes to Python strings or
   numbers, and this way the new syntax is also less
   backwards-incompatible.

7. If all the previous rules match, the attribute is set to the base
   variable. If setting fails for any reason, an exception is raised
   and the test fails.

.. note:: Unlike when assigning variables normally using `return
          values from keywords`_, changes to variables done using the
          extended assign syntax are not limited to the current
          scope. Because no new variable is created but instead the
          state of an existing variable is changed, all tests and
          keywords that see that variable will also see the changes.

Variables inside variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables are allowed also inside variables, and when this syntax is
used, variables are resolved from the inside out. For example, if you
have a variable `${var${x}}`, then `${x}` is resolved
first. If it has the value `name`, the final value is then the
value of the variable `${varname}`. There can be several nested
variables, but resolving the outermost fails, if any of them does not
exist.

In the example below, :name:`Do X` gets the value `${JOHN HOME}`
or `${JANE HOME}`, depending on if :name:`Get Name` returns
`john` or `jane`. If it returns something else, resolving
`${${name} HOME}` fails.

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Variables ***
   ${JOHN HOME}    /home/john
   ${JANE HOME}    /home/jane

   *** Test Cases ***
   Example
       ${name} =    Get Name
       Do X    ${${name} HOME}


.. _inline Python evaluation:

Inline Python evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variable syntax can also be used for evaluating Python expressions. The
basic syntax is `${{expression}}` i.e. there are double curly braces around
the expression. The `expression` can be any valid Python expression such as
`${{1 + 2}}` or `${{['a', 'list']}}`. Spaces around the expression are allowed,
so also `${{ 1 + 2 }}` and `${{ ['a', 'list'] }}` are valid. In addition to
using normal `scalar variables`_, also `list variables`_ and
`dictionary variables`_ support `@{{expression}}` and `&{{expression}}` syntax,
respectively.

Main usages for this pretty advanced functionality are:

- Evaluating Python expressions involving Robot Framework's variables
  (`${{len('${var}') > 3}}`, `${{$var[0] if $var is not None else None}}`).

- Creating values that are not Python base types
  (`${{decimal.Decimal('0.11')}}`, `${{datetime.date(2019, 11, 5)}}`).

- Creating values dynamically (`${{random.randint(0, 100)}}`,
  `${{datetime.date.today()}}`).

- Constructing collections, especially nested collections (`${{[1, 2, 3, 4]}}`,
  `${{ {'id': 1, 'name': 'Example', 'children': [7, 9]} }}`).

- Accessing constants and other useful attributes in Python modules
  (`${{math.pi}}`, `${{platform.system()}}`).

This is somewhat similar functionality than the `extended variable syntax`_
discussed earlier. As the examples above illustrate, this syntax is even more
powerful as it provides access to Python built-ins like `len()` and modules
like `math`. In addition to being able to use variables like `${var}` in
the expressions (they are replaced before evaluation), variables are also
available using the special `$var` syntax during evaluation. The whole expression
syntax is explained in the `Evaluating expressions`_ appendix.

.. tip:: Instead of creating complicated expressions, it is often better
         to move the logic into a `custom library`__. That eases
         maintenance, makes test data easier to understand and can also
         enhance execution speed.

.. note:: The inline Python evaluation syntax is new in Robot Framework 3.2.
