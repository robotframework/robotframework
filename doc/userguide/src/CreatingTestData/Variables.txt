Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables are an integral feature of Robot Framework, and they can be
used in most places in test data. Most commonly, they are used in
arguments for keywords in test case tables and keyword tables, but
also all settings allow variables in their values. A normal keyword
name *cannot* be specified with a variable, but the `BuiltIn
keyword`_ :name:`Run Keyword` can be used to get the same effect.

Robot Framework itself has two kinds of variables, scalars__ and lists__,
and they have the syntaxes :var:`${SCALAR}` and :var:`@{LIST}`,
respectively. In addition to this, `environment variables`_ can be used
directly with the syntax :var:`%{VARIABLE}`.

.. warning:: Using scalar variables and list variables with the same
             base name, for example :var:`${VAR}` and :var:`@{VAR}`,
             has been deprecated in Robot Framework 2.5. For more
             information, see `issue 484`__ in the issue tracker.

The use of variables is recommended in the following cases:

- When strings change often in the test data. With variables you only
  need to make these changes in one place.

- When creating system-independent and operating-system-independent
  test data. Using variables instead of hard-coded strings eases that
  considerably (for example, :var:`${RESOURCES}` instead of
  :code:`c:\\resources`, or :var:`${HOST}` instead of
  :code:`10.0.0.1:8080`). Because variables can be `set from the
  command line`__ when tests are started, changing system-specific
  variables is easy (for example, :cli:`--variable HOST:10.0.0.2:1234
  --variable RESOURCES:/opt/resources`). This also facilitates
  localization testing, which often involves running the same tests
  with different strings.

- When there is a need to have objects other than strings as arguments
  for keywords.

- When different keywords, even in different test libraries, need to
  communicate. You can assign a return value from one keyword to a
  variable and give that as an argument to another.

- When values in the test data are long or otherwise complicated. For
  example, :var:`${URL}` is shorter than
  :code:`\http://long.domain.name:8080/path/to/service?foo=1&bar=2&zap=42`.

If a nonexistent variable is used in the test data, the keyword using
it fails. If the same syntax that is used for variables is needed as a
literal string, it must be `escaped with a backslash`__ as in :code:`\\${NAME}`.

Variable types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different variable types are briefly described in this section. The
creation and usage of variables is described in more detail in the
following subsections.

Robot Framework variables, similarly as keywords, are
case-insensitive, and also spaces and underscores are
ignored. However, it is recommended to use all capital letters with
global variables (for example, :var:`${PATH}` or :var:`${TWO_WORDS}`)
and small letters with variables that are only available in certain
test cases or user keywords (for example, :var:`${my_var}` or
:var:`${myVar}`). Much more importantly, though, cases should be used
consistently.

Unlike in some programming languages where similar variable syntax is
used, curly braces (:code:`{` and :code:`}`) are mandatory in Robot Framework test
data. Basically, variable names can have any characters between the
curly braces. However, using only alphabetic characters from a to z,
numbers, underscore and space is recommended, and it is
even a requirement for using the `extended variable syntax`_.

Scalar variables
''''''''''''''''

When scalar variables are used in the test data, they are replaced
with the value they are assigned to. While scalar variables are most
commonly used for simple strings, you can assign any objects,
including lists, to them. The scalar variable syntax, for example
:var:`${NAME}`, should be familiar to most users, as it is also used,
for example, in shell scripts and Perl programming language.

The example below illustrates the usage of scalar variables. Assuming
that the variables :var:`${GREET}` and :var:`${NAME}` are available
and assigned to strings :code:`Hello` and :code:`world`, respectively,
both the example test cases are equivalent.

.. table:: Scalar variables with string values
   :class: example

   ============  ========  ====================  ==========
    Test Case     Action        Argument          Argument
   ============  ========  ====================  ==========
   Strings       Log       Hello
   \             Log       Hello, world!!
   Variables     Log       ${GREET}
   \             Log       ${GREET}, ${NAME}!!
   ============  ========  ====================  ==========

When a scalar variable is used as the only value in a test data cell,
the scalar variable is replaced with the value it has. The value may
be any object. When a scalar variable is used in a test data cell with
anything else (constant strings or other variables), its value is
first converted into a Unicode string and then catenated to whatever is in
that cell. Converting the value into a string means that the object's
method :code:`__unicode__` (in Python, with :code:`__str__` as a fallback)
or :code:`toString` (in Java) is called.

.. note:: Variable values are used as-is without conversions also when
          passing arguments to keywords using the `named arguments`_
          syntax like :code:`argname=${var}`.

The example below demonstrates the difference between having a
variable in a cell alone or with other content. First, let us assume
that we have a variable :var:`${STR}` set to a string :code:`Hello,
world!` and :var:`${OBJ}` set to an instance of the following Java
object:

.. sourcecode:: java

 public class MyObj {

     public String toString() {
         return "Hi, tellus!";
     }
 }

With these two variables set, we then have the following test data:

.. table:: Scalar variables with objects as values
   :class: example

   ===========  ========  =================  ==========
    Test Case    Action        Argument       Argument
   ===========  ========  =================  ==========
   Objects      KW 1      ${STR}
   \            KW 2      ${OBJ}
   \            KW 3      I said "${STR}"
   \            KW 4      You said "${OBJ}"
   ===========  ========  =================  ==========

Finally, when this test data is executed, different keywords receive
the arguments as explained below:

- :name:`KW 1` gets a string :code:`Hello, world!`
- :name:`KW 2` gets an object stored to variable :var:`${OBJ}`
- :name:`KW 3` gets a string :code:`I said "Hello, world!"`
- :name:`KW 4` gets a string :code:`You said "Hi, tellus!"`

.. Note:: Converting variables to Unicode obviously fails if the variable
          cannot be represented as Unicode. This can happen, for example,
          if you try to use byte sequences as arguments to keywords so that
          you catenate the values together like :code:`${byte1}${byte2}`.
          A workaround is creating a variable that contains the whole value
          and using it alone in the cell (e.g. :code:`${bytes}`) because then
          the value is used as-is.

List variables
''''''''''''''

List variables are compound variables that can have several
values assigned to them. In short, they are always lists and can
contain an unlimited number of entries (also empty lists are
possible). The main benefit of list variables is that they allow you
to assign a name for a larger data set. While list variables normally
contain only strings, other content is also possible.

When you use a list variable in test data, then the elements of the list
are inserted as new cells in the test data. Thus, if the list variable
contains two elements, the cell containing the list variable is turned
into two cells with the content of the list variable. Note that cells
with list variables should not contain other content. The list variable
syntax, :var:`@{NAME}`, is borrowed from Perl.

Assuming that the list variable :var:`@{USER}` is set to the value
:code:`['robot','secret']`, the following two test cases
are equivalent.

.. table:: Using list variables
   :class: example

   =============  ========  ===========  ==========
     Test Case     Action    User Name    Password
   =============  ========  ===========  ==========
   Strings        Login     robot        secret
   List Variable  Login     @{USER}
   =============  ========  ===========  ==========

Accessing individual list variable items
````````````````````````````````````````

It is also possible to access a certain value from the list variable
with the syntax :var:`@{NAME}[i]`, where :var:`i` is the index of the
selected value. Indexes start from zero, and trying to access a value
with too large an index causes an error. List items accessed in this
manner can be used similarly as scalar variables:

.. table:: Accessing list variable items
   :class: example

   =============  ===============  ===================  ==========
     Test Case        Action            Argument         Argument
   =============  ===============  ===================  ==========
   Strings        Login            robot                secret
   \              Title Should Be  Welcome robot!
   List Variable  Login            @{USER}
   \              Title Should Be  Welcome @{USER}[0]!
   =============  ===============  ===================  ==========

Using list variables as scalar variables
````````````````````````````````````````

It is possible to use list variables as scalar variables containing
lists simply by replacing :var:`@` with :var:`$`. This makes it
possible to use list variables with list related keywords, for
example, from BuiltIn_ and Collections_ libraries. This feature
works only if there is no scalar variable with same base name as the
list variable has. In these cases the scalar variable has precedence
and its value is used instead.

.. table:: Using list variables as scalars
   :class: example

   =============  ================  ==============  ==========  ==========
     Test Case         Action          Argument      Argument    Argument

   \              Length Should Be  ${items}        2
   \              Append To List    ${items}        third
   \              Length Should Be  ${items}        3
   \              Remove From List  ${items}        1
   \              Length Should Be  ${items}        2
   \              Log Many          @{items}
   =============  ================  ==============  ==========  ==========

Using list variables with settings
``````````````````````````````````

List variables can be used only with some of the settings__. They can
be used in arguments to imported libraries and variable files, but
library and variable file names themselves cannot be list
variables. Also with setups and teardowns list variable can not be used
as the name of the keyword, but can be used in arguments. With tag related
settings they can be used freely. Using scalar variables is possible in
those places where list variables are not supported.

.. table:: Using list variables with settings
   :class: example

   ==============  ================  ===============  ====================
      Settings          Value            Value             Comment
   ==============  ================  ===============  ====================
   Library         ExampleLibrary    @{LIB ARGS}      # This works
   Library         ${LIBRARY}        @{LIB ARGS}      # This works
   Library         @{NAME AND ARGS}                   # This does not work
   Suite Setup     Some Keyword      @{KW ARGS}       # This works
   Suite Setup     ${KEYWORD}        @{KW ARGS}       # This works
   Suite Setup     @{KEYWORD}                         # This does not work
   Default Tags    @{TAGS}                            # This works
   ==============  ================  ===============  ====================

Environment variables
'''''''''''''''''''''

Robot Framework allows using environment variables in the test
data using the syntax :var:`%{ENV_VAR_NAME}`. They are limited to string
values.

Environment variables set in the operating system before the test execution are
available during it, and it is possible to create new ones with the keyword
:name:`Set Environment Variable` or delete existing ones with the
keyword :name:`Delete Environment Variable`, both available in the
`OperatingSystem library`_. Because environment variables are global,
environment variables set in one test case can be used in other test
cases executed after it. However, changes to environment variables are
not effective after the test execution.

   =============  ========  =====================  ==========

   =============  ========  =====================  ==========

Java system properties
''''''''''''''''''''''

When running tests with Jython, it is possible to access `Java system properties`__
using same syntax as `environment variables`_. If an environment variable and a
system property with same name exist, the environment variable will be used.
Support for accessing Java system properties was added in Robot Framework 2.6.

Creating variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables can spring into existence from different sources as
described in the subsections below.

Variable table
''''''''''''''

The most common source for variables are Variable tables in `test case
files`_ and `resource files`_. Variable tables are convenient, because they
allow creating variables in the same place as the rest of the test
data, and the needed syntax is very simple. Their main disadvantage is
that they only enable assigning variables into strings or a list of
strings. If other value types are needed, `variable files`_ are
probably a better option.

Creating scalar variables
`````````````````````````

The simplest possible variable assignment is setting a string into a
scalar variable. This is done by giving the variable name (including
:var:`${}`) in the first column of the Variable table and the value in
the second one. If the second column is empty, an empty string is set
as a value. Also an already defined variable can be used in the value.

.. table:: Creating scalar variables
   :class: example

   ============  ==================  =========
     Variable           Value          Value
   ============  ==================  =========
   ${NAME}       Robot Framework
   ${VERSION}    2.0
   ${ROBOT}      ${NAME} ${VERSION}
   ============  ==================  =========

It is also possible, but not obligatory,
to use the equals sign :code:`=` after the variable name to make assigning
variables slightly more explicit.

.. table:: Creating scalar variables using the equals sign
   :class: example

   ============  ===============  =========
     Variable         Value         Value
   ============  ===============  =========
   ${NAME} =     Robot Framework
   ${VERSION} =  2.0
   ============  ===============  =========

Creating list variables
```````````````````````

Creating list variables is as easy as creating scalar variables. Again, the
variable name is in the first column of the Variable table and
values in the subsequent columns. A list variable can have any number
of values, starting from zero, and if many values are needed, they
can be `split into several rows`__.

__ `Dividing test data to several rows`_

.. table:: Creating list variables

   ============  =========  =========  =========
     Variable      Value      Value      Value
   ============  =========  =========  =========
   @{NAMES}      Matti      Teppo
   @{NAMES2}     @{NAMES}   Seppo
   @{NOTHING}
   @{MANY}       one        two        three
   ...           four       five       six
   ...           seven
   ============  =========  =========  =========

Variable file
'''''''''''''

Variable files are the most powerful mechanism for creating different
kind of variables. It is possible to assign variables to any object
using them, and they also enable creating variables dynamically. The
variable file syntax and taking variable files into use is explained
in section `Resource and variable files`_.

Setting variables in command line
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Variables can be set from the command line either individually with
the :opt:`--variable (-v)` option or using a variable file with the
:opt:`--variablefile (-V)` option. Variables set from the command line
are globally available for all executed test data files, and they also
override possible variables with the same names in the Variable table and in
variable files imported in the test data.

The syntax for setting individual variables is :cli:`--variable
name:value`, where :cli:`name` is the name of the variable without
:var:`${}` and :cli:`value` is its value. Several variables can be
set by using this option several times. Only scalar variables can be
set using this syntax and they can only get string values. Many
special characters are difficult to represent in the
command line, but they can be escaped__ with the :opt:`--escape`
option.

__ `Escaping complicated characters`_

.. sourcecode:: bash

   --variable EXAMPLE:value
   --variable HOST:localhost:7272 --variable USER:robot
   --variable ESCAPED:Qquotes_and_spacesQ --escape quot:Q --escape space:_

In the examples above, variables are set so that

- :var:`${EXAMPLE}` gets the value :code:`value`
- :var:`${HOST}` and :var:`${USER}` get the values
  :code:`localhost:7272` and :code:`robot`
- :var:`${ESCAPED}` gets the value :code:`"quotes and spaces"`

The basic syntax for taking `variable files`_ into use from the command line
is :cli:`--variablefile path/to/variables.py`, and `Taking variable files into
use`_ section has more details. What variables actually are created depends on
what variables there are in the referenced variable file.

If both variable files and individual variables are given from the command line,
the latter have `higher priority`__.

__ `Variable priorities and scopes`_

Return values from keywords
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Return values from keywords can also be set into variables. This
allows communication between different keywords even in different test
libraries. The syntax for a simple case is illustrated in the example below:

.. table:: Assigning values from keywords to variables
   :class: example

   ===========  ==========  ============  ============
    Test Case     Action      Argument      Argument
   ===========  ==========  ============  ============
   Returning    ${x} =      Get X         an argument
   \            Log         We got ${x}!
   ===========  ==========  ============  ============

In the example above, the value returned by the :name:`Get X` keyword is
first set into the variable :var:`${x}` and then used by the :name:`Log`
keyword. This syntax works in all cases where a keywords returns
something, and the variable is set to whatever value returned by the
keyword. Having the equals sign :code:`=` after the variable name is
not obligatory, but recommended, because it makes the assignment
more explicit.

If a keyword returns a list, it is also possible to assign the return
value into several scalar variables and/or one list variable. Starting
from Robot Framework 2.5 this works with all list-like objects, but
prior to it only Python lists and tuples and Java arrays were supported.

.. table:: Assigning multiple values at once
   :class: example

   ===============  ============  ==========  ==========  ==========
      Test Case        Action      Argument    Argument    Argument
   ===============  ============  ==========  ==========  ==========
   Return Multiple  ${scalar} =   Get 3
   \                ${a}          ${b}        ${c} =      Get 3
   \                ${first}      @{rest} =   Get 3
   \                @{list} =     Get 3
   ===============  ============  ==========  ==========  ==========

Assuming that the keyword :name:`Get 3` returns a list
:code:`[1, 2, 3]`, the following variables are created:

- :var:`${scalar}` with the value :code:`[1, 2, 3]`
- :var:`${a}`, :var:`${b}` and :var:`${c}` with the values :code:`1`,
  :code:`2`, and :code:`3`, respectively
- :var:`${first}` with the value :code:`1`, and :var:`@{rest}` with the value
  :code:`[2, 3]`
- :var:`@{list}` with the value :code:`[1, 2, 3]`

Variables set in this manner are otherwise similar to any other
variables, but they are available only within the scope of the test
case or keyword where they are created. Thus it is not possible, for
example, to set a variable in one test case and use it in another. This is
because, in general, automated test cases should not depend on each
other, and accidentally setting a variable that is used elsewhere
could cause hard-to-debug errors. If there is a genuine need for
setting a variable in one test case and using it in another, it is
possible to use built-in keywords as explained in the next section.

Using built-in :name:`Set Test/Suite/Global Variable` keywords
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The `BuiltIn library`_ has keywords :name:`Set Test Variable`,
:name:`Set Suite Variable` and :name:`Set Global Variable` which can
be used for setting variables dynamically during the test
execution. If a variable already exists within the new scope, its
value will be overwritten, and otherwise a new variable is created.

Variables set with :name:`Set Test Variable` keyword are available
everywhere within the scope of the currently executed test case. For
example, if you set a variable in a user keyword, it is available both
in the test case level and also in all other user keywords used in the
current test. Other test cases will not see variables set with this
keyword.

Variables set with :name:`Set Suite Variable` keyword are available
everywhere within the scope of the currently executed test
suite. Setting variables with this keyword thus has the same effect as
creating them using the `Variable table`_ in the test data file or
importing them from `variable files`_. Other test suites, including
possible child test suites, will not see variables set with this
keyword.

Variables set with :name:`Set Global Variable` keyword are globally
available in all test cases and suites executed after setting
them. Setting variables with this keyword thus has the same effect as
`creating from the command line`__ using the options :opt:`--variable` or
:opt:`--variablefile`. Because this keyword can change variables
everywhere, it should be used with care.

Built-in variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework provides some built-in variables that are available
automatically.

Operating-system variables
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Built-in variables related to the operating system ease making the test data
operating-system-agnostic.

Number variables
''''''''''''''''

The variable syntax can be used for creating both integers and
floating point numbers, as illustrated in the example below. This is
useful when a keyword expects to get an actual number, and not a
string that just looks like a number, as an argument.

Starting from Robot Framework 2.6, it is possible to create integers
also from binary, octal, and hexadecimal values using :var:`0b`, :var:`0o`
and :var:`0x` prefixes, respectively. The syntax is case insetive.

   \            Should Be Equal  ${0B1010}   ${0XA}

Boolean and None/null variables
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Also Boolean values and Python :code:`None` and Java :code:`null` can
be created using the variable syntax similarly as numbers.

   ===========  ===============  ==========  ==========  =============================================
    Test Case        Action       Argument    Argument                      Comment
   ===========  ===============  ==========  ==========  =============================================
   Boolean      Set Status       ${true}                 # Set Status gets Boolean true as an argument
   \            Create Y         something   ${false}    # Create Y gets a string and Boolean false
   None         Do XYZ           ${None}                 # Do XYZ gets Python None as an argument
   Null         ${ret} =         Get Value   arg         # Checking that Get Value returns Java null
   \            Should Be Equal  ${ret}      ${null}
   ===========  ===============  ==========  ==========  =============================================

These variables are case-insensitive, so for example :var:`${True}` and
:var:`${true}` are equivalent. Additionally, :var:`${None}` and
:var:`${null}` are synonyms, because when running tests on the Jython
interpreter, Jython automatically converts :code:`None` and
:code:`null` to the correct format when necessary.

Space and empty variables
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

It is possible to create spaces and empty strings using variables
:var:`${SPACE}` and :var:`${EMPTY}`, respectively. These variables are
useful, for example, when there would otherwise be a need to `escape
spaces or empty cells`__ with a backslash. If more than one space is
needed, it is possible to use the `extended variable syntax`_ like
:var:`${SPACE * 5}`.  In the following example, :name:`Should Be
Equal` keyword gets identical arguments but those using variables are
easier to understand than those using backslashes.

Some automatic variables can also be used in the test data. These
variables can have different values during the test execution and some
of them are not even available all the time.

Variable priorities and scopes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables coming from different sources have different priorities and
are available in different scopes.

Variable priorities
'''''''''''''''''''

*Variables from the command line*

   Variables `set in the command line`__ have the highest priority of all
   variables that can be set before the actual test execution starts. They
   override possible variables created in Variable tables in test case
   files, as well as in resource and variable files imported in the
   test data.

   Individually set variables (:opt:`--variable` option) override the
   variables set using `variable files`_ (:opt:`--variablefile` option).
   If you specify same individual variable multiple times, the one specified
   last will override earlier ones. This allows setting default values for
   variables in a `start-up script`__ and overriding them from the command line.
   Notice, though, that if multiple variable files have same variables, the
   ones in the file specified first have the highest priority.

__ `Setting variables in command line`_
__ `Creating start-up scripts`_

*Variable table in a test case file*

   Variables created using the `Variable table`_ in a test case file
   are available for all the test cases in that file. These variables
   override possible variables with same names in imported resource and
   variable files.

   Variables created in the variable tables are available in all other tables
   in the file where they are created. This means that they can be used also
   in the Setting table, for example, for importing more variables from
   resource and variable files.

*Imported resource and variable files*

   Variables imported from the `resource and variable files`_ have the
   lowest priority of all variables created in the test data.
   Variables from resource files and variable files have the same
   priority. If several resource and/or variable file have same
   variables, the ones in the file imported first are taken into use.

   If a resource file imports resource files or variable files,
   variables in its own Variable table have a higher priority than
   variables it imports. All these variables are available for files that
   import this resource file.

   Note that variables imported from resource and variable files are not
   available in the Variable table of the file that imports them. This
   is due to the Variable table being processed before the Setting table
   where the resource files and variable files are imported.

*Variables set during test execution*

   Variables set during the test execution either using `return values
   from keywords`_ or `built-in keywords`__ :name:`Set
   Test/Suite/Global Variable` always override possible existing
   variables in the scope where they are set. In a sense they thus
   have the highest priority, but on the other hand they do not affect
   variables outside the scope they are defined.

__ `Using built-in Set Test/Suite/Global Variable keywords`_

*Built-in variables*

   `Built-in variables`_ like :var:`${TEMPDIR}` and :var:`${TEST_NAME}`
   have the highest priority of all variables. They cannot be overridden
   using Variable table or from command line, but even they can be reset during
   the test execution. An exception to this rule are `number variables`_, which
   are resolved dynamically if no variable is found otherwise. They can thus be
   overridden, but that is generally a bad idea. Additionally :var:`${CURDIR}`
   is special because it is replaced already during the test data processing time.

Variable scopes
'''''''''''''''

Depending on where and how they are created, variables can have a
global, test suite, test case or user keyword scope.

*Global scope*

   Global variables are available everywhere in the test data. These
   variables are normally `set from the command line`__ with the
   :opt:`--variable` and :opt:`--variablefile` options, but it is also
   possible to create new global variables or change the existing ones
   with the `BuiltIn keyword`_ :name:`Set Global Variable` anywhere in
   the test data. Additionally also `built-in variables`_ are global.

   It is recommended to use capital letters with all global variables.

*Test suite scope*

   Variables with the test suite scope are available anywhere in the
   test suite where they are defined or imported. They can be created
   in Variable tables, imported from `resource and variable files`_,
   or set during the test execution using the `BuiltIn keyword`_
   :name:`Set Suite Variable`.

   The test suite scope *is not recursive*, which means that variables
   available in a higher-level test suite *are not available* in
   lower-level suites. If necessary, `resource and variable files`_ can
   be used for sharing variables.

   Since these variables can be considered global in the test suite where
   they are used, it is recommended to use capital letters also with them.

*Test case scope*

   Variables created in test cases from the return values of keywords have a
   test case scope and they are available only in that test
   case. Another possibility to create them is using the `BuiltIn keyword`_
   :name:`Set Test Variable` anywhere in that particular test case. Test
   case variables are local and should use lower-case letters.

*User keyword scope*

   User keywords get their own variables from `arguments passed to them`__
   and return values from the keywords they use. Also these variables
   are local and should use lower-case letters.

__ `Setting variables in command line`_
__ `User keyword arguments`_

Advanced variable features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extended variable syntax
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Extended variable syntax can be used with objects set into scalar
variables. It allows accessing the attributes of the object (for example,
:var:`${obj.name}` or :var:`${obj.some_attr}`), and even calling
its methods (for example, :var:`${obj.get_name()}` or
:var:`${obj.getSomething('arg')}`).

Extended variable syntax is a powerful feature, but it should
be used with care. Accessing attributes is normally not a problem, on
the contrary, as one variable with an object having several
attributes is often better than having several variables. On the
other hand, calling methods, especially when they are used with
arguments, can make the test data complicated. If that happens,
it is recommended to move the code into a test library.

The most common usages of extended variable syntax are illustrated
in the example below. First assume that we have the following `variable file`_
and test case:

.. sourcecode:: python

   class MyObject:

       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def eat(self, what):
           return '%s eats %s' % (self.name, what)

       def __str__(self):
           return self.name

   OBJECT = MyObject('Robot')
   DICTIONARY = { 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}

.. table::
   :class: example

   ===========  ========  =========================  ==========
    Test Case    Action          Argument             Argument
   ===========  ========  =========================  ==========
   Example      KW 1      ${OBJECT.name}
   \            KW 2      ${OBJECT.eat('Cucumber')}
   \            KW 3      ${DICTIONARY[2]}
   ===========  ========  =========================  ==========

When this test data is executed, the keywords get the arguments as
explained below:

- :name:`KW 1` gets string :code:`Robot`
- :name:`KW 2` gets string :code:`Robot eats Cucumber`
- :name:`KW 3` gets string :code:`two`

The extended variable syntax is evaluated in the following order:

1. The variable is searched using the full variable name. The extended
   variable syntax is evaluated only if no matching variable
   is found.

2. The real name of the base variable is created. The body of the name
   consists of all the characters after :var:`${` until the first
   occurrence of a non-alphanumeric character or a space (for example,
   :var:`OBJECT` in :var:`${OBJECT.name}` and :var:`DICTIONARY` in
   :var:`${DICTIONARY[2]}`).

3. A variable matching the body is searched. If there is no match, an
   exception is raised and the test case fails.

4. The expression inside the curly brackets is evaluated as a Python
   expression, so that the base variable name is replaced with its
   value. If the evaluation fails because of an invalid syntax or that
   the queried attribute does not exist, an exception is raised and
   the test fails.

5. The whole extended variable is replaced with the value returned
   from the evaluation.

If the object that is used is implemented with Java, the extended
variable syntax allows you to access attributes using so-called bean
properties. In essence, this means that if you have an object with the
:code:`getName`  method set into a variable :var:`${OBJ}`, then the
syntax :var:`${OBJ.name}` is equivalent to but clearer than
:var:`${OBJ.getName()}`. The Python object used in the previous example
could thus be replaced with the following Java implementation:

.. sourcecode:: java

 public class MyObject:

     private String name;

     public MyObject(String name) {
         name = name;
     }

     public String getName() {
         return name;
     }

     public String eat(String what) {
         return name + " eats " + what;
     }

     public String toString() {
         return name;
     }
 }

Many standard Python objects, including strings and numbers, have
methods that can be used with the extended variable syntax either
explicitly or implicitly. Sometimes this can be really useful and
reduce the need for setting temporary variables, but it is also easy
to overuse it and create really cryptic test data. Following examples
show few pretty good usages.

.. table:: Using methods of strings and numbers
   :class: example

   ===========  ============  ===================  ===============
    Test Case      Action           Argument          Argument
   ===========  ============  ===================  ===============
   String       ${string} =   Set Variable         abc
   \            Log           ${string.upper()}    # Logs 'ABC'
   \            Log           ${string * 2}        # Logs 'abcabc'
   Number       ${number} =   Set Variable         ${-2}
   \            Log           ${number * 10}       # Logs -20
   \            Log           ${number.__abs__()}  # Logs 2
   ===========  ============  ===================  ===============

Note that even though :code:`abs(number)` is recommended over
:code:`number.__abs__()` in normal Python code, using
:var:`${abs(number)}` does not work. This is because the variable name
must be in the beginning of the extended syntax. Using :code:`__xxx__`
methods in the test data like this is already a bit questionable, and
it is normally better to move this kind of logic into test libraries.

Extended variable assignment
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Starting from Robot Framework 2.7, it is possible to set attributes of
objects stored to scalar variables using `keyword return values`__ and
a variation of the `extended variable syntax`_. Assuming we have
variable :var:`${OBJECT}` from the previous examples, attributes could
be set to it like in the example below.

__ `Return values from keywords`_

.. table:: Extended variable assignment
   :class: example

   ===========  ====================  ==============  ===============
    Test Case          Action            Argument         Argument
   ===========  ====================  ==============  ===============
   Example      ${OBJECT.name} =      Set Variable    New name
   \            ${OBJECT.new_attr} =  Set Variable    New attribute
   ===========  ====================  ==============  ===============

The extended variable assignment syntax is evaluated using the
following rules:

1. The assigned variable must be a scalar variable and have at least
   one dot. Otherwise the extended assignment syntax is not used and
   the variable is assigned normally.

2. If there exists a variable with the full name
   (e.g. :var:`${OBJECT.name}` in the example above) that variable
   will be assigned a new value and the extended syntax is not used.

3. The name of the base variable is created. The body of the name
   consists of all the characters between the opening :var:`${` and
   the last dot, for example, :var:`OBJECT` in :var:`${OBJECT.name}`
   and :var:`foo.bar` in :var:`${foo.bar.zap}`. As the second example
   illustrates, the base name may contain normal extended variable
   syntax.

4. The name of the attribute to set is created by taking all the
   characters between the last dot and the closing :var:`}`, for
   example, :var:`name` in :var:`${OBJECT.name}`. If the name does not
   start with a letter or underscore and contain only these characters
   and numbers, the attribute is considered invalid and the extended
   syntax is not used. A new variable with the full name is created
   instead.

5. A variable matching the base name is searched. If no variable is
   found, the extended syntax is not used and, instead, a new variable
   is created using the full variable name.

6. If the found variable is a string or a number, the extended syntax
   is ignored and a new variable created using the full name. This is
   done because you cannot add new attributes to Python strings or
   numbers, and this way the new syntax is also less
   backwards-incompatible.

7. If all the previous rules match, the attribute is set to the base
   variable. If setting fails for any reason, an exception is raised
   and the test fails.

.. note:: Unlike when assigning variables normally using `return
          values from keywords`_, changes to variables done using the
          extended assign syntax are not limited to the current
          scope. Because no new variable is created but instead the
          state of an existing variable is changed, all tests and
          keywords that see that variable will also see the changes

Variables inside variables
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Variables are allowed also inside variables, and when this syntax is
used, variables are resolved from the inside out. For example, if you
have a variable :var:`${var${x}}`, then :var:`${x}` is resolved
first. If it has the value :code:`name`, the final value is then the
value of the variable :var:`${varname}`. There can be several nested
variables, but resolving the outermost fails, if any of them does not
exist.

In the example below, :name:`Do X` gets the value :var:`${JOHN HOME}`
or :var:`${JANE HOME}`, depending on if :name:`Get Name` returns
:code:`john` or :code:`jane`. If it returns something else, resolving
:var:`${${name} HOME}` fails.
