Creating test libraries
-----------------------

Robot Framework's actual testing capabilities are provided by test
libraries. There are many existing libraries, some of which are even
bundled with the core framework, but there is still often a need to
create new ones. This task is not too complicated because, as this
chapter illustrates, Robot Framework's library API is simple
and straightforward.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supported programming languages
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Robot Framework itself is written with Python_ and naturally test
libraries extending it can be implemented using the same
language. When running the framework on Jython_, libraries can also be
implemented using Java_. Pure Python code works both on Python and
Jython, assuming that it does not use syntax or modules that are not
available on Jython. When using Python, it is also possible to
implement libraries with C using `Python C API`__, although it is
often easier to interact with C code from Python libraries using
ctypes__ module.

Libraries implemented using these natively supported languages can
also act as wrappers to functionality implemented using other
programming languages. A good example of this approach is the `Remote
library`_, and another widely used approaches is running external
scripts or tools as separate processes.

.. tip:: `Python Tutorial for Robot Framework Test Library Developers`__
         covers enough of Python language to get started writing test
         libraries using it. It also contains a simple example library
         and test cases that you can execute and otherwise investigate
         on your machine.

Different test library APIs
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Robot Framework has three different test library APIs.

Static API

  The simplest approach is having a module (in Python) or a class
  (in Python or Java) with methods which map directly to
  `keyword names`_. Keywords also take the same `arguments`__ as
  the methods implementing them.  Keywords `report failures`__ with
  exceptions, `log`__ by writing to standard output and can `return
  values`__ using the :code:`return` statement.

Dynamic API

  Dynamic libraries are classes that implement a method to get the names
  of the keywords they implement, and another method to execute a named
  keyword with given arguments. The names of the keywords to implement, as
  well as how they are executed, can be determined dynamically at
  runtime, but reporting the status, logging and returning values is done
  similarly as in the static API.

Hybrid API

  This is a hybrid between the static and the dynamic API. Libraries are
  classes with a method telling what keywords they implement, but
  those keywords must be available directly. Everything else except
  discovering what keywords are implemented is similar as in the
  static API.

All these APIs are described in this chapter. Everything is based on
how the static API works, so its functions are discussed first. How
the `dynamic library API`_ and the `hybrid library API`_ differ from it
is then discussed in sections of their own.

The examples in this chapter are mainly about using Python, but they
should be easy to understand also for Java-only developers. In those
few cases where APIs have differences, both usages are explained with
adequate examples.

Creating test library class or module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test libraries can be implemented as Python modules and Python or Java
classes.

Test library names
''''''''''''''''''

The name of a test library that is used when a library is imported is
the same as the name of the module or class implementing it. For
example, if you have a Python module :code:`MyLibrary` (that is, the
file :path:`MyLibrary.py`), it will create a library with a name
:name:`MyLibrary`. Similarly, a Java class :code:`YourLibrary`, when
it is not in any package, creates a library with exactly that name.

Python classes are always inside a module. If the name of a class
implementing a library is the same as the name of the module, Robot
Framework allows dropping the module name when importing the
library. For example, the class :code:`MyLib` in the :path:`MyLib.py`
file can be used as a library with the name :name:`MyLib`. If the
module name and class name are different, libraries must be taken into
use using both module and class names, such as
:name:`mymodule.MyLibrary`.

Java classes in a non-default package must be taken into use with the
full name. For example, the class :code:`MyLib` in the
:code:`com.mycompany.myproject` package must be imported with the name
:name:`com.mycompany.myproject.MyLib`.

.. tip:: If the library name is really long, for example when the Java
         package name is long, it is recommended to give the library a
         simpler alias by using the `WITH NAME syntax`_.

Providing arguments to test libraries
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

All test libraries implemented as classes can take arguments. These
arguments are specified in the Setting table after the library name,
and when Robot Framework creates an instance of the imported library,
it passes them to its constructor. Libraries implemented as a module
cannot take any arguments, so trying to use those results in an error.

The number of arguments needed by the library is the same
as the number of arguments accepted by the library's
constructor. The default values and variable number of arguments work
similarly as with `keyword arguments`_, with the exception that there
is no variable argument support for Java libraries. Arguments passed
to the library, as well as the library name itself, can be specified
using variables, so it is possible to alter them, for example, from the
command line.

.. table:: Importing a test library with arguments
   :class: example

   =========  ===========  =========  =======
    Setting      Value       Value     Value
   =========  ===========  =========  =======
   Library    MyLibrary    10.0.0.1   8080
   Library    AnotherLib   ${VAR}
   =========  ===========  =========  =======

Example implementations, first one in Python and second in Java, for
the libraries used in the above example:

.. sourcecode:: python

  from example import Connection

  class MyLibrary:

      def __init__(self, host, port=80):
          self._conn = Connection(host, int(port))

      def send_message(self, message):
          self._conn.send(message)

.. sourcecode:: java

   public class AnotherLib {

       private String setting = null;

       public AnotherLib(String setting) {
           setting = setting;
       }

       public void doSomething() {
           if setting.equals("42") {
               // do something ...
           }
       }
   }

Test library scope
''''''''''''''''''

Libraries implemented as classes can have an internal state, which can
be altered by keywords and with arguments to the constructor of the
library. Because the state can affect how keywords actually behave, it
is important to make sure that changes in one test case do not
accidentally affect other test cases. These kind of dependencies may
create hard-to-debug problems, for example, when new test cases are
added and they use the library inconsistently.

Robot Framework attempts to keep test cases independent from each
other: by default, it creates new instances of test libraries for
every test case. However, this behavior is not always desirable,
because sometimes test cases should be able to share a common
state. Additionally, all libraries do not have a state and creating
new instances of them is simply not needed.

Test libraries can control when new libraries are created with a
class attribute :code:`ROBOT_LIBRARY_SCOPE` . This attribute must be
a string and it can have the following three values:

`TEST CASE`:code:
  A new instance is created for every test case. A possible suite setup
  and suite teardown share yet another instance. This is the default.

`TEST SUITE`:code:
  A new instance is created for every test suite. The lowest-level test
  suites, created from test case files and containing test cases, have
  instances of their own, and higher-level suites all get their own instances
  for their possible setups and teardowns.

`GLOBAL`:code:
  Only one instance is created during the whole test execution and it
  is shared by all test cases and test suites. Libraries created from
  modules are always global.

When the :code:`TEST SUITE` or :code:`GLOBAL` scopes are used with test
libraries that have a state, it is recommended that libraries have some
special keyword for cleaning up the state. This keyword can then be
used, for example, in a suite setup or teardown to ensure that test
cases in the next test suites can start from a known state. For example,
:name:`SeleniumLibrary` uses the :code:`GLOBAL` scope to enable
using the same browser in different test cases without having to
reopen it, and it also has the :name:`Close All Browsers` keyword for
easily closing all open browsers.

Example Python library using the :code:`TEST SUITE` scope:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class ExampleLibrary:

        ROBOT_LIBRARY_SCOPE = 'TEST SUITE'

        def __init__(self):
            self._counter = 0

        def count(self):
            self._counter += 1
            print self._counter

        def clear_counter(self):
            self._counter = 0

Example Java library using the :code:`GLOBAL` scope:

.. sourcecode:: java

    public class ExampleLibrary {

        public static final String ROBOT_LIBRARY_SCOPE = "GLOBAL";

        private int counter = 0;

        public void count() {
            counter += 1;
            System.out.println(counter);
        }

        public void clearCounter() {
            counter = 0;
        }
    }

Specifying library version
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When a test library is taken into use, Robot Framework tries to
determine its version. This information is then written into the syslog_
to provide debugging information. Library documentation tool
`libdoc.py`_ also writes this information into the keyword
documentations it generates.

Version information is read from attribute
:code:`ROBOT_LIBRARY_VERSION`, similarly as `test library scope`_ is
read from :code:`ROBOT_LIBRARY_SCOPE`. If
:code:`ROBOT_LIBRARY_VERSION` does not exist, information is tried to
be read from :code:`__version__` attribute. These attributes must be
class or module attributes, depending whether the library is
implemented as a class or a module.  For Java libraries the version
attribute must be declared as :code:`static final`.

An example Python module using :code:`__version__`:

.. sourcecode:: python

    __version__ = '0.1'

    def keyword():
        pass

A Java class using :code:`ROBOT_LIBRARY_VERSION`:

.. sourcecode:: java

    public class VersionExample {

        public static final String ROBOT_LIBRARY_VERSION = "1.0.2";

        public void keyword() {
        }
    }

Creating static keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What methods are considered keywords
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When the static library API is used, Robot Framework uses reflection
to find out what public methods the library class or module
implements. It will exclude all methods starting with an underscore,
and with Java libraries also methods that are implemented only in
:code:`java.lang.Object` are ignored. All the methods that are not
ignored are considered keywords. For example, the Python and Java
libraries below implement single keyword :name:`My Keyword`.

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyLibrary:

        def my_keyword(self, arg):
            return self._helper_method(arg)

        def _helper_method(self, arg):
            return arg.upper()

.. sourcecode:: java

    public class MyLibrary {

        public String myKeyword(String arg) {
            return helperMethod(arg);
        }

        private String helperMethod(String arg) {
            return arg.toUpperCase();
        }
    }

When the library is implemented as a Python module, it is also
possible to limit what methods are keywords by using Python's
:code:`__all__` attribute. If :code:`__all__` is used, only methods
listed in it can be keywords. For example, the library below
implements keywords :name:`Example Keyword` and :name:`Second
Example`. Without :code:`__all__`, it would implement also keywords
:name:`Not Exposed As Keyword` and :name:`Current Thread`. The most
important usage for :code:`__all__` is making sure imported helper
methods, such as :code:`current_thread` in the example below, are not
accidentally exposed as keywords.

.. sourcecode:: python

   from threading import current_thread

   __all__ = ['example_keyword', 'second_example']

   def example_keyword():
       if current_thread().name == 'MainThread':
           print 'Running in main thread'

   def second_example():
       pass

   def not_exposed_as_keyword():
       pass

.. note:: Support for the :code:`__all__` attribute is available from
          Robot Framework 2.5.5 onwards.

Keyword names
'''''''''''''

Keyword names used in the test data are compared with method names to
find the method implementing these keywords. Name comparison is
case-insensitive, and also spaces and underscores are ignored. For
example, the method :code:`hello` maps to the keyword name
:name:`Hello`, :name:`hello` or even :name:`h e l l o`. Similarly both the
:code:`do_nothing` and :code:`doNothing` methods can be used as the
:name:`Do Nothing` keyword in the test data.

Example Python library implemented as a module in the :path:`MyLibrary.py` file:

.. sourcecode:: python

  def hello(name):
      print "Hello, %s!" % name

  def do_nothing():
      pass

Example Java library implemented as a class in the :path:`MyLibrary.java` file:

.. sourcecode:: java

  public class MyLibrary {

      public void hello(String name) {
          System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
      }

      public void doNothing() {
      }

  }

The example below illustrates how the example libraries above can be
used. If you want to try this yourself, make sure that the library is
in the `library search path`_.

   \            Hello        world
   ===========  ===========  ============  ============

Keyword arguments
'''''''''''''''''

With a static and hybrid API, the information on how many arguments a
keyword needs is got directly from the method that implements it.
Libraries using the `dynamic library API`_ have other means for sharing
this information, so this section is not relevant to them.

The most common and also simplest situation is when a keyword needs an
exact number of arguments. In this case, both the Python and Java methods
simply take exactly those arguments. For example, a method implementing a
keyword with no arguments takes no arguments either, a method
implementing a keyword with one argument also takes one argument, and
so on.

Example Python keywords taking different numbers of arguments:

.. sourcecode:: python

  def no_arguments():
      print "Keyword got no arguments"

  def one_argument(arg):
      print "Keyword got one argument '%s'" % arg

  def multiple_arguments(a1, a2, a3):
      print "Keyword got three arguments '%s', '%s' and '%s'" % (a1, a2, a3)

Default values to keywords
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

It is often useful that some of the arguments that a keyword uses have
default values. Python and Java have different syntax for handling default
values to methods, and the natural syntax of these languages can be
used when creating test libraries for Robot Framework.

Default values with Python
``````````````````````````
In Python a method has always exactly one implementation and possible
default values are specified in the method signature. The syntax,
which is familiar to all Python programmers, is illustrated below:

.. sourcecode:: python

   def one_default(arg='default'):
       print "Argument has value '%s'" % arg

   def multiple_defaults(arg1, arg2='default 1', arg3='default 2'):
       print "Got arguments %s, %s and %s" % (arg1, arg2, arg3)

The first example keyword above can be used either with zero or one
arguments. If no arguments are given, :code:`arg` gets the value
:code:`default`. If there is one argument, :code:`arg` gets that value,
and calling the keyword with more than one argument fails. In the
second example, one argument is always required, but the second and
the third one have default values, so it is possible to use the keyword
with one to three arguments.

.. table:: Using keywords with variable number of arguments
   :class: example

   ===========  ==================  =============  ============  =============
    Test Case         Action          Argument       Argument       Argument
   ===========  ==================  =============  ============  =============
   Defaults     One Default
   \            One Default         argument
   \            Multiple Defaults   required arg
   \            Multiple Defaults   required arg   optional
   \            Multiple Defaults   required arg   optional 1    optional 2
   ===========  ==================  =============  ============  =============

Default values with Java
````````````````````````
In Java one method can have several implementations with different
signatures. Robot Framework regards all these implementations as one
keyword, which can be used with different arguments. This syntax can
thus be used to provide support for the default values. This is
illustrated by the example below, which is functionally identical to
the earlier Python example:

.. sourcecode:: java

   public void oneDefault(String arg) {
       System.out.println("Argument has value '" + arg "'");
   }

   public void oneDefault() {
       oneDefault("default");
   }

   public void multipleDefaults(String arg1, String arg2, String arg3) {
       System.out.println("Got arguments " + arg1 + ", " + arg2 + " and " + arg3);
   }

   public void multipleDefaults(String arg1, String arg2) {
       multipleDefaults(arg1, arg2, "default 2");
   }

   public void multipleDefaults(String arg1) {
       multipleDefaults(arg1, "default 1");
   }

Variable number of arguments
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Robot Framework supports also keywords that take any number of
arguments. Similarly as with the default values, the actual syntax to use
in test libraries is different in Python and Java.

Variable number of arguments with Python
````````````````````````````````````````
Python supports methods accepting any number of arguments. The same
syntax works in libraries and, as the examples below show, it can also
be combined with other ways of specifying arguments:

.. sourcecode:: python

  def any_arguments(*args):
      print "Got arguments:"
      for arg in args:
          print arg

  def one_required(required, *others):
      print "Required: %s\nOthers:" % required
      for arg in others:
          print arg

  def also_defaults(req, def1="default 1", def2="default 2", *rest):
      print req, def1, def2, rest

   \                Also Defaults   1              2             3
   \                ...             4              5             6
   ===============  =============  =============  ============  ==============

Variable number of arguments with Java
``````````````````````````````````````
Robot supports Java varargs syntax for defining variable number of
arguments.  Robot also will translate an array as the last argument in
a keyword signature as a list of variable number of arguments. In this
case, all leftover arguments to the keyword are packed into the
list. This also works if the keyword is used with one argument less
than the actual number of arguments in the signature - in this case
the array at the end will be empty.

Robot's support for variable number of arguments in Java has one
limitation: it only works if the method has only one signature. Thus
it is not possible to have a Java keyword that has both the default
values and a variable number of arguments.  Of course, having a number
of required arguments is still possible, as the examples below
illustrate:

.. sourcecode:: java

  public void anyNumberOfArguments(String... varargs) {
      System.out.println("Got arguments:");
      for (String arg: varargs) {
          System.out.println(arg);
      }
  }

  public void oneArgumentRequired(String required, String... others) {
      System.out.println("Required: " + required + "\nOthers:");
      for (String arg: others) {
          System.out.println(arg);
      }
  }

  public void usingAnArray(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Got arguments:");
      for (String arg: args) {
          System.out.println(arg);
      }
  }

Argument types
''''''''''''''

Normally keyword arguments come to Robot Framework as strings. If
keywords require some other types, it is possible to either use
variables_ or convert strings to required types inside keywords. With
`Java keywords`__ base types are also coerced automatically.

__ `Argument types with Java`_

Argument types with Python
``````````````````````````
Because arguments in Python do not have any type information, there is
no possibility to automatically convert strings to other types when
using Python libraries. Calling a Python method implementing a keyword
with a correct number of arguments always succeeds, but the execution
fails later if the arguments are incompatible. Luckily with Python it
is simple to convert arguments to suitable types inside keywords:

.. sourcecode:: python

  def connect_to_host(address, port=25):
      port = int(port)
      # ...

Argument types with Java
````````````````````````
Arguments to Java methods have types, and all the base types are
handled automatically. This means that arguments that are normal
strings in the test data are coerced to correct type at runtime. The
types that can be coerced are:

- integer types (:code:`byte`, :code:`short`, :code:`int`, :code:`long`)
- floating point types (:code:`float` and :code:`double`)
- the :code:`boolean` type
- object versions of the above types e.g. :code:`java.lang.Integer`

The coercion is done for arguments that have the same or compatible
type across all the signatures of the keyword method. In the following
example, the conversion can be done for keywords :code:`doubleArgument`
and :code:`compatibleTypes`, but not for :code:`conflictingTypes`.

.. sourcecode:: java

   public void doubleArgument(double arg) {}

   public void compatibleTypes(String arg1, Integer arg2) {}
   public void compatibleTypes(String arg2, Integer arg2, Boolean arg3) {}

   public void conflictingTypes(String arg1, int arg2) {}
   public void conflictingTypes(int arg1, String arg2) {}

The coercion works with the numeric types if the test data has a
string containing a number, and with the boolean type the data must
contain either string :code:`true` or :code:`false`. Coercion is only
done if the original value was a string from the test data, but it is
of course still possible to use variables containing correct types with
these keywords. Using variables is the only option if keywords have
conflicting signatures.

Communicating with Robot Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a method implementing a keyword is called, it can use any
mechanism to communicate with the system under test. It can then also
send messages to Robot Framework's log file, return information that
can be saved to variables and, most importantly, report if the
keyword passed or not.

Reporting keyword status
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Reporting keyword status is done simply using exceptions. If an executed
method raises an exception, the keyword status is :msg:`FAIL`, and if it
returns normally, the status is :msg:`PASS`.

The error message shown in logs, reports and the console is created
from the exception type and its message. With generic exceptions (for
example, :code:`AssertionError`, :code:`Exception`, and
:code:`RuntimeError`), only the exception message is used, and with
others, the message is created in the format :msg:`ExceptionType:
Actual message`. In both cases, it is important for the users that the
exception message is as informative as possible.

If the error message is longer than 40 lines, it will be automatically
cut from the middle to prevent reports from getting too long and
difficult to read. The full error message is always shown in the log
message of the failed keyword.

The traceback of the exception is also logged using :msg:`DEBUG` `log level`_.
These messages are not visible in log files by default because they are very
rarely interesting for normal users. When developing libraries, it is often a
good idea to run tests using :cli:`--loglevel DEBUG`.

Stopping test execution
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Starting from Robot Framework 2.5 it is possible to fail a test case so that
`the whole test execution is stopped`__. This is done simply by having a special
:code:`ROBOT_EXIT_ON_FAILURE` attribute with :code:`True` value set on the
exception raised from the keyword. This is illustrated in the examples below.

Python:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyFatalError(RuntimeError):
        ROBOT_EXIT_ON_FAILURE = True

Java:

.. sourcecode:: java

    public class MyFatalError extends RuntimeException {
        public static final boolean ROBOT_EXIT_ON_FAILURE = true;
    }

__ `Stopping test execution gracefully`_

Continuing test execution despite of failures
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Starting from Robot Framework 2.5 it is possible to `continue test
execution even when there are failures`__. The way to signal this from
test libraries is adding a special :code:`ROBOT_CONTINUE_ON_FAILURE`
attribute with :code:`True` value to the exception used to communicate
the failure. This is demonstrated by the examples below.

Python:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyContinuableError(RuntimeError):
        ROBOT_CONTINUE_ON_FAILURE = True

Java:

.. sourcecode:: java

    public class MyContinuableError extends RuntimeException {
        public static final boolean ROBOT_CONTINUE_ON_FAILURE = true;
    }

__ `Continue on failure`_

Logging information
'''''''''''''''''''

Exception messages are not the only way to give information to the
users. In addition to them, methods can also send messages to `log
files`_ simply by writing to the standard output stream (stdout) or to
the standard error stream (stderr), and they can even use different
`log levels`_. Another, and often better, logging possibility is using
the `programmatic logging APIs`_.

By default, everything written by a method into the standard output is
written to the log file as a single entry with the log level
:msg:`INFO`. Messages written into the standard error are handled
similarly otherwise, but they are echoed back to the original stderr
after the keyword execution has finished. It is thus possible to use
the stderr if you need some messages to be visible on the console where
tests are executed.

Using log levels
````````````````
To use other log levels than :msg:`INFO`, or to create several
messages, specify the log level explicitly by embedding the level into
the message in the format :code:`*LEVEL* Actual log message`, where
:code:`*LEVEL*` must be in the beginning of a line and :msg:`LEVEL` is
one of the available logging levels :msg:`TRACE`, :msg:`DEBUG`,
:msg:`INFO`, :msg:`WARN` and :msg:`HTML`.

Warnings
````````
Messages with :msg:`WARN` level are automatically written into `the
console and into separate Test Execution Errors section`__ in log
files. This makes warnings more visible than other messages and allows
using them for reporting important but non-critical problems to users.

__ `Errors and warnings during execution`_

Logging HTML
````````````
Everything normally logged by the library will be converted into a
format that can be safely represented as HTML. For example,
:code:`<b>foo</b>` will be displayed in the log exactly like that and
not as **foo**. If libraries want to use formatting, links, display
images and so on, they can use a special pseudo log level
:msg:`HTML`. Robot Framework will write these messages directly into
the log with the :msg:`INFO` level, so they can use any HTML syntax
they want. Notice that this feature needs to be used with care, because
one badly placed :code:`</table>` tag can ruin the log file quite
badly.

Timestamps
``````````
By default messages logged via the standard output or error streams
get their timestamps when the executed keyword ends. This means that
the timestamps are not accurate and debugging problems especially with
longer running keywords can be problematic.

Starting from Robot Framework 2.6 keywords have a possibility to add
an accurate timestamp to the messages they log if there is a need. The
timestamp must be given as milliseconds since the `Unix epoch`__ and it
must be placed after the `log level`__ separated from it with a colon::

   *INFO:1308435758660* Message with timestamp
   *HTML:1308435758661* <b>HTML</b> message with timestamp

As illustrated by the examples below, adding the timestamp is easy
both using Python and Java. If you are using Python, it is, however,
even easier to get accurate timestamps using the `programmatic logging
APIs`_. A big benefit of this mechanism is that it works also with the
`remote library interface`_.

Python:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import time

    def example_keyword():
        print '*INFO:%d* Message with timestamp' % (time.time()*1000)

Java:

.. sourcecode:: java

    public void exampleKeyword() {
        System.out.println("*INFO:" + System.currentTimeMillis() + "* Message with timestamp");
    }

__ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_epoch
__ `Using log levels`_

Logging to console
``````````````````
If libraries need to write something to the console they have three
options.

As already discussed, warnings as well as all messages written to the
standard error stream are written both to the log file and to the
console. Both of these options have a limitation that the messages end
up to the console only after the currently executing keyword finishes.
A bonus is that these approaches work both with Python and Java based
libraries.

The third option, that is only available with Python, is writing
messages to :code:`sys.__stdout__`. Robot Framework only intercepts
:code:`sys.stdout` and :code:`sys.stderr` and leaves
:code:`sys.__stdout__` (and :code:`sys.__stderr__`) alone like all
well behaving Python programs should. When using
:code:`sys.__stdout__` messages end up to the console immediately and
are not written to the log file at all.

Logging example
```````````````
In most cases, the :msg:`INFO` level is adequate. The levels below it,
:msg:`DEBUG` and :msg:`TRACE`, are useful for writing debug information.
These messages are normally not shown, but they can facilitate debugging
possible problems in the library itself. The :msg:`WARN` level can
be used to make messages more visible and :msg:`HTML` is useful if any
kind of formatting is needed.

The following examples clarify how logging with different levels
works. Java programmers should regard the code :code:`print 'message'`
as pseudocode meaning :code:`System.out.println("message");`.

.. sourcecode:: python

   print 'Hello from a library.'
   print '*WARN* Warning from a library.'
   print '*INFO* Hello again!'
   print 'This will be part of the previous message.'
   print '*INFO* This is a new message.'
   print '*INFO* This is <b>normal text</b>.'
   print '*HTML* This is <b>bold</b>.'
   print '*HTML* <a href="http://robotframework.org">Robot Framework</a>'

.. raw:: html

     <tr>
       <td class="time">16:18:42.123</td>

Programmatic logging APIs
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Programmatic APIs provide somewhat cleaner way to log information than
using the standard output and error streams. Currently these
interfaces are available only to Python bases test libraries.

Public logging API
``````````````````

Robot Framework 2.6 has a new Python based logging API for writing
messages to the log file and to the console. Test libraries can use
this API like :code:`logger.info('My message')` instead of logging
through the standard output like :code:`print '*INFO* My message'`. In
addition to a programmatic interface being a lot cleaner to use, this
API has a benefit that the log messages have accurate timestamps_. An
obvious limitation is that test libraries using this logging API have
a dependency to Robot Framework.

The public logging API is documented as part of the API documentation but
here is a simple usage example:

.. FIXME: Link to API docs.

.. sourcecode:: python

   from robot.api import logger

   def my_keyword(arg):
       logger.debug('Got argument %s' % arg)
       do_something()
       logger.info('<i>This</i> is a boring example', html=True)
       logger.console('Hello, console!')

Using Python's standard :code:`logging` module
``````````````````````````````````````````````

In addition to the new `public logging API`_, Robot Framework 2.6 also
added a built-in support to Python's standard logging__ module. This
works so that all messages that are received by the root logger of the
module are automatically propagated to Robot Framework's log
file. Also this API produces log messages with accurate timestamps_,
but logging HTML messages or writing messages to the console are not
supported. A big benefit, illustrated also by the simple example
below, is that using this logging API creates no dependency to Robot
Framework.

.. sourcecode:: python

   import logging

   def my_keyword(arg):
       logging.debug('Got argument %s' % arg)
       do_something()
       logging.info('This is a boring example')

The :code:`logging` module has slightly different log levels than
Robot Framework. Its levels :msg:`DEBUG` and :msg:`INFO` are mapped
directly to the matching Robot Framework log levels and :msg:`WARNING`
and everything above is mapped to :msg:`WARN`. Custom levels below
:msg:`DEBUG` are mapped to :msg:`DEBUG` and everything between
:msg:`DEBUG` and :msg:`WARNING` is mapped to :msg:`INFO`.

__ http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html

Logging during library initialization
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Libraries can also log during the test library import and initialization.
These messages do not appear in the `log file`_ like the normal log messages,
but are instead written to the `syslog`_. This allows logging any kind of
useful debug information about the library initialization. Messages logged
using the :msg:`WARN` level are also visible in the `test execution errors`_
section in the log file.

Logging during the import and initialization is possible both using the
`standard output and error streams`__ and the `programmatic logging APIs`_.
Both of these are demonstrated below.

Java library logging via stdout during initialization:

.. sourcecode:: java

   public class LoggingDuringInitialization {

       public LoggingDuringInitialization() {
           System.out.println("*INFO* Initializing library");
       }

       public void keyword() {
           // ...
       }
   }

Python library logging using the logging API during import:

.. sourcecode:: python

   from robot.api import logger

   logger.debug("Importing library")

   def keyword():
       # ...

.. note:: If you log something during initialization, i.e. in Python
          :code:`__init__` or in Java constructor, the messages may be
          logged multiple times depending on the `test library scope`_.

.. note:: The support for writing log messages to the syslog during the
          library initialization is a new feature in Robot Framework 2.6.

__ `Logging information`_

Returning values
''''''''''''''''

The final way for keywords to communicate back to the core framework
is returning information retrieved from the system under test or
generated by some other means. The returned values can be `assigned to
variables`__ in the test data and then used as inputs for other keywords,
even from different test libraries.

Values are returned using the :code:`return` statement both from
the Python and Java methods. Normally, one value is assigned into one
`scalar variable`__, as illustrated in the example below. This example
also illustrates that it is possible to return any objects and to use
`extended variable syntax`_ to access object attributes.

__ `Return values from keywords`_
__ `Scalar variables`_

.. sourcecode:: python

  from mymodule import MyObject

  def return_string():
      return "Hello, world!"

  def return_object(name):
      return MyObject(name)

.. table:: Return one value from keywords
   :class: example

   ================  ===============  ==============
   ${string} =       Return String
   Should Be Equal   ${string}        Hello, world!
   ${object} =       Return Object    Robot
   Should Be Equal   ${object.name}   Robot
   ================  ===============  ==============

Keywords can also return values so that they can be assigned into
several `scalar variables`_ at once, into `a list variable`__, or
into scalar variables and a list variable. All these usages require
that returned values are Python lists or tuples or
in Java arrays, Lists, or Iterators.

__ `List variables`_

.. sourcecode:: python

  def return_two_values():
      return 'first value', 'second value'

  def return_multiple_values():
      return ['a', 'list', 'of', 'strings']


.. table:: Returning multiple values
   :class: example

   ================  ==================  ==================  =======================
   ${var1}           ${var2} =           Return Two Values
   Should Be Equal   ${var1}             first value
   Should Be Equal   ${var2}             second value
   @{list} =         Return Two Values
   Should Be Equal   @{list}[0]          first value
   Should Be Equal   @{list}[1]          second value
   ${s1}             ${s2}               @{li} =             Return Multiple Values
   Should Be Equal   ${v1} ${v2}         a list
   Should Be Equal   @{li}[0] @{li}[1]   of strings
   ================  ==================  ==================  =======================

Communication when using threads
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If a library uses threads, it should generally communicate with the
framework only from the main thread. If a worker thread has, for
example, a failure to report or something to log, it should pass the
information first to the main thread, which can then use exceptions or
other mechanisms explained in this section for communication with the
framework.

This is especially important when threads are run on background while
other keywords are running. Results of communicating with the
framework in that case are undefined and can in works case cause a
crash or a corrupted output file. If a keyword starts something on
background, there should be another keyword that checks the status of
the worker thread and reports gathered information accordingly.

.. note:: Messages logged by non-main threads using the `programmatic
          logging APIs`_ are silently ignored starting from Robot
          Framework 2.6.2.

Distributing test libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documenting libraries
'''''''''''''''''''''

A test library without documentation about what keywords it
contains and what those keywords do is rather useless. To ease
maintenance, it is highly recommended that library documentation is
included in the source code and generated from it. Basically, that
means using docstrings_ with Python and Javadoc_ with Java, as in
the examples below.

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyLibrary:
        """This is an example library with some documentation."""

        def keyword_with_short_documentation(self, argument):
            """This keyword has only a short documentation"""
            pass

        def keyword_with_longer_documentation(self):
            """First line of the documentation is here.

            Longer documentation continues here and it can contain
            multiple lines or paragraphs.
            """
            pass

.. sourcecode:: java

    /**
     *  This is an example library with some documentation.
     */
    public class MyLibrary {

        /**
         * This keyword has only a short documentation
         */
        public void keywordWithShortDocumentation(String argument) {
        }

        /**
         * First line of the documentation is here.
         *
         * Longer documentation continues here and it can contain
         * multiple lines or paragraphs.
         */
        public void keywordWithLongerDocumentation() {
        }

    }

Both Python and Java have tools for creating an API documentation of a
library documented as above. However, outputs from these tools can be slightly
technical for some users. Another alternative is using Robot
Framework's own documentation tool `libdoc.py`_. This tool can
create a library documentation from both Python and Java libraries
using the static library API, such as the ones above, but it also handles
libraries using the `dynamic library API`_ and `hybrid library API`_.

The first line of a keyword documentation is used for a special
purpose and should contain a short overall description of the
keyword. It is used as a *short documentation*, for example as a tool
tip, by `libdoc.py`_ and also shown in the test logs. However, the latter
does not work with Java libraries using the static API,
because their documentations are lost in compilation and not available
at runtime.

.. note:: If you want to use non-ASCII charactes in the documentation of
          Python libraries, you must either use UTF-8 as your `source code
          encoding`__ or create docstrings as Unicode.

.. _docstrings: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257
.. _javadoc: http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html
__ http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263

Testing libraries
'''''''''''''''''

Any non-trivial test library needs to be thoroughly tested to prevent
bugs in them. Of course, this testing should be automated to make it
easy to rerun tests when libraries are changed.

Both Python and Java have excellent unit testing tools, and they suite
very well for testing libraries. There are no major differences in
using them for this purpose compared to using them for some other
testing. The developers familiar with these tools do not need to learn
anything new, and the developers not familiar with them should learn
them anyway.

It is also easy to use Robot Framework itself for testing libraries
and that way have actual end-to-end acceptance tests for them. There are
plenty of useful keywords in the `BuiltIn library`_ for this
purpose. One worth mentioning specifically is :name:`Run Keyword And Expect
Error`, which is useful for testing that keywords report errors
correctly.

Whether to use a unit- or acceptance-level testing approach depends on
the context. If there is a need to simulate the actual system under
test, it is often easier on the unit level. On the other hand,
acceptance tests ensure that keywords do work through Robot
Framework. If you cannot decide, of course it is possible to use both
the approaches.

Packaging libraries
'''''''''''''''''''

After a library is implemented, documented, and tested, it still needs
to be distributed to the users. With simple libraries consisting of a
single file, it is often enough to ask the users to copy that file
somewhere and set the `library search path`_ accordingly. More
complicated libraries should be packaged to make the installation
easier.

Since libraries are normal programming code, they can be packaged
using normal packaging tools. With Python, good options include
distutils_, contained by Python's standard library, and the newer
setuptools_. A benefit of these tools is that library modules are
installed into a location that is automatically in the `library
search path`_.

When using Java, it is natural to package libraries into a JAR
archive. The JAR package must be put into the `library search path`_
before running tests, but it is easy to `create a start-up`__ script that
does that automatically.

__ `Creating start-up scripts`_

Deprecating keywords
''''''''''''''''''''

Sometimes there is a need to replace existing keywords with new ones
or remove them altogether. Just informing the users about the change
may not always be enough, and it is more efficient to get warnings at
runtime. To support that, Robot Framework has a capability to mark
keywords *deprecated*. This makes it easier to find old keywords from
the test data and remove or replace them.

Keywords are deprecated by starting their documentation with
:code:`*DEPRECATED*`. When these keywords are executed, a warning
containing rest of the `short documentation`__ is written both into
`the console and into separate Test Execution Errors section`__ in log
files.  For example, if following keyword is executed there will be a
warning like shown below in the log file.

.. sourcecode:: python

    def example_keyword(argument):
        """*DEPRECATED* Use keyword `Other Keyword` instead.

        This keyword does something to given `argument` and returns the result.
        """
        return do_something(argument)

.. raw:: html

   <table class="messages">
     <tr>
       <td class="time">20080911&nbsp;16:00:22.650</td>
       <td class="warn level">WARN</td>
       <td class="msg">Keyword 'SomeLibrary.Example Keyword' is deprecated. Use keyword `Other Keyword` instead.</td>
     </tr>
   </table>

This deprecation system works with most test libraries and also with
`user keywords`__.  The only exception are keywords implemented in a
Java test library that uses the `static library interface`__ because
their documentation is not available at runtime. With such keywords,
it possible to use user keywords as wrappers and deprecate them.

There is a plan to implement a tool that can use the deprecation
information for automatically replacing deprecated keywords. The tool
will most likely get the name of the new keyword from the
documentation so that it searches words inside backticks
(:code:`\``). Thus it would find :name:`Other Keyword` from the
earlier example. Note that `libdoc.py`_ also automatically creates
internal links using the same syntax.

Dynamic library API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dynamic API is in most ways similar to the static API. For
example, reporting the keyword status, logging, and returning values
works exactly the same way. Most importantly, there are no differences
in importing dynamic libraries and using their keywords compared to
other libraries, so you do not even need to know what APIs the
libraries use.

The only difference between static and dynamic libraries is the way
how Robot Framework discovers what keywords the library implements,
what arguments and documentation they have and how those keywords are
actually executed. With the static API, all this is done using
reflection (except for the documentation of Java libraries), but
dynamic libraries have special methods that are used for these
purposes.

One of the benefits of the dynamic API is that you have more
flexibility in organizing your library. With the static API, you have all
keywords in one class (or module), whereas with the dynamic API, you can,
for example, implement each keyword as a separate class, if you
want. This use case is not so important with Python, because
its dynamic capabilities and multi-inheritance already give plenty of
flexibility and the `hybrid library API`_ is usually a better option.

Another major use case for the dynamic API is implementing a library
so that it is only a proxy for an actual library on some other
computer or another JVM. This kind of a proxy library can be very
thin, and because keyword names are got dynamically, there is no
need to update the proxy when new keywords are added into the actual
library.

This section explains how the dynamic API works between Robot
Framework and dynamic libraries. It does not matter for Robot
Framework how these libraries are actually implemented (for example,
how calls to the :code:`run_keyword` method are mapped to a correct
keyword implementation), and many different approaches are
possible. However, if you use Java, you may want to examine
`JavaTools`_ before implementing your own system. This collection of
reusable tools supports several ways of creating keywords, and it is
likely that it already has a mechanism that suites your needs.

Getting keyword names
'''''''''''''''''''''

Dynamic libraries tell what keywords they implement with the
:code:`get_keyword_names` method. The method also has the alias
:code:`getKeywordNames` that is recommended when writing Java. This
method cannot take any arguments, and it must return a list of strings
(in Python) or a string array (in Java) containing the names of the
keywords that the library implements.

If the returned keyword names contain several words, they can be returned
separated with spaces or underscores, or in the camelCase format. For
example, :code:`['first keyword', 'second keyword']`,
:code:`['first_keyword', 'second_keyword']`, and
:code:`['firstKeyword', 'secondKeyword']` would all result in the keywords
:name:`First Keyword` and :name:`Second Keyword`.

Dynamic libraries must always have this method. If it is missing, or
if calling it fails for some reason, the library is considered a
static library, instead.

Running keywords
''''''''''''''''

Dynamic libraries have a special :code:`run_keyword` (alias
:code:`runKeyword`) method for executing their keywords. When a
keyword from a dynamic library is used in the test data, Robot
Framework uses the library's :code:`run_keyword` method to get it
executed. This method takes two arguments. The first argument is a
string containing the name of the keyword to be executed in the same
format as returned by :code:`get_keyword_names`. The second argument is
a list of arguments (an object array in Java) given to the keyword in
the test data.

After the library has got the keyword name and arguments, it can
execute the keyword freely, but it must use the same mechanism to
communicate with the framework as static libraries. This
means using exceptions for reporting keyword status, logging by
writing to the standard output and using the return statement in
:code:`run_keyword` for returning something.

Every dynamic library must have both the :code:`get_keyword_names` and
:code:`run_keyword` methods. The rest of the methods in the dynamic
API are optional, so the example below shows a working (albeit
trivial) dynamic library.

.. sourcecode:: python

   class DynamicExample:

       def get_keyword_names(self):
           return ['first keyword', 'second keyword']

       def run_keyword(self, name, args):
           print "Running keyword %s with arguments %s" % (name, args)

Getting keyword arguments
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

If a dynamic library only implements the :code:`get_keyword_names` and
:code:`run_keyword` methods, Robot Framework does not have any information
about the arguments that the implemented keywords need. For example,
both :name:`First Keyword` and :name:`Second Keyword` in the example above
could be used with any number of arguments. This is problematic,
because most real keywords expect a certain number of keywords, and
under these circumstances they would need to check the argument counts
themselves.

Dynamic libraries can tell Robot Framework what arguments the keywords
that it implements actually expect using
:code:`get_keyword_arguments` (alias :code:`getKeywordArguments`)
method. This method takes the name of a keyword as an argument and returns a
list of strings (a string array in Java) containing the arguments
accepted by that keyword.

Similarly as static keywords, dynamic keywords can require any number
of arguments, have default values and accept a variable number of
arguments. The syntax for how to represent all these different
situations is explained in the following table. Note that the examples
use Python lists of strings, but Java developers should be able to
translate them to string arrays.

When the :code:`get_keyword_arguments` is used, Robot Framework
automatically calculates how many arguments the keywords require. If a
keyword is used with an invalid number of arguments, an error occurs
and :code:`run_keyword` is not even called. The last column of the
table above shows the minimum and maximum argument counts calculated
from the presented examples.

The actual argument names do not matter when tests are executed,
because only argument counts are of concern to Robot Framework. On the
other hand, if the `libdoc.py`_ tool is used for documenting the
library, arguments are shown in the documentation, in which case they
need to have meaningful names.

Getting keyword documentation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The final special method that dynamic libraries can implement is
:code:`get_keyword_documentation` (alias
:code:`getKeywordDocumentation`). It takes a keyword name as an
argument and, as the method name implies, returns its documentation as
a string.

The returned documentation is used similarly as the keyword
documentation string with static libraries implemented with
Python. The main use case is getting keywords' documentations into a
library documentation generated with `libdoc.py`_. Additionally,
the first line of the documentation (until the first :code:`\\n`) is
shown in test logs.

Getting general library documentation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The :code:`get_keyword_documentation` method can also be used for
specifying overall library documentation. This documentation is not
used when tests are executed, but it can make the documentation
generated by `libdoc.py`_ much better.

Dynamic libraries can provide both general library documentation and
documentation related to taking the library into use. The former is
got by calling :code:`get_keyword_documentation` with special value
:code:`__intro__`, and the latter is got using value
:code:`__init__`. How the documentation is presented is best tested
with `libdoc.py`_ in practice.

Python based dynamic libraries can also specify the general library
documentation directly in the code as the docstring of the library
class or its :code:`__init__` method. If non-empty documentation is
got both directly from the code and from the
:code:`get_keyword_documentation` method, the latter has higher
priority.

.. note:: Getting general library documentation is supported in Robot
          Framework 2.6.2 and newer.

Summary
'''''''

All special methods in the dynamic API are listed in the table
below. Method names are listed in the underscore format, but their
camelCase aliases work exactly the same way.

It is possible to write a formal interface specification in Java, as
below. However, remember that libraries *do not need* to implement
any explicit interface, because Robot Framework directly checks with
reflection if the library has the required :code:`get_keyword_names` and
:code:`run_keyword` methods. Additionally,
:code:`get_keyword_arguments` and :code:`get_keyword_documentation`
are completely optional.

.. sourcecode:: java

   public interface RobotFrameworkDynamicAPI {

       String[] getKeywordNames();

       Object runKeyword(String name, Object[] arguments);

       String[] getKeywordArguments(String name);

       String getKeywordDocumentation(String name);

   }

A good example of using the dynamic API is Robot Framework's own
`Remote library`_.

Hybrid library API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hybrid library API is, as its name implies, a hybrid between the
static API and the dynamic API. Just as with the dynamic API, it is
possible to implement a library using the hybrid API only as a class.

Getting keyword names
'''''''''''''''''''''

Keyword names are got in the exactly same way as with the dynamic
API. In practice, the library needs to have the
:code:`get_keyword_names` or :code:`getKeywordNames` method returning
a list of keyword names that the library implements.

Running keywords
''''''''''''''''

In the hybrid API, there is no :code:`run_keyword` method for executing
keywords. Instead, Robot Framework uses reflection to find methods
implementing keywords, similarly as with the static API. A library
using the hybrid API can either have those methods implemented
directly or, more importantly, it can handle them dynamically.

In Python, it is easy to handle missing methods dynamically with the
:code:`__getattr__` method. This special method is probably familiar
to most Python programmers and they can immediately understand the
following example. Others may find it easier to consult `Python Reference
Manual`__ first.

__ http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#attribute-access

.. sourcecode:: python

   from somewhere import external_keyword

   class HybridExample:

       def get_keyword_names(self):
           return ['my_keyword', 'external_keyword']

       def my_keyword(self, arg):
           print "My Keyword called with '%s'" % arg

       def __getattr__(self, name):
           if name == 'external_keyword':
               return external_keyword
           raise AttributeError("Non-existing attribute '%s'" % name)

Note that :code:`__getattr__` does not execute the actual keyword like
:code:`run_keyword` does with the dynamic API. Instead, it only
returns a callable object that is then executed by Robot Framework.

Another point to be noted is that Robot Framework uses the same names that
are returned from :code:`get_keyword_names` for finding the methods
implementing them. Thus the names of the methods that are implemented in
the class itself must be returned in the same format as they are
defined. For example, the library above would not work correctly, if
:code:`get_keyword_names` returned :code:`My Keyword` instead of
:code:`my_keyword`.

The hybrid API is not very useful with Java, because it is not
possible to handle missing methods with it. Of course, it is possible
to implement all the methods in the library class, but that brings few
benefits compared to the static API.

Getting keyword arguments and documentation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When this API is used, Robot Framework uses reflection to find the
methods implementing keywords, similarly as with the static API. After
getting a reference to the method, it searches for arguments and
documentation from it, in the same way as when using the static
API. Thus there is no need for special methods for getting arguments
and documentation like there is with the dynamic API.

Summary
'''''''

When implementing a test library in Python, the hybrid API has the same
dynamic capabilities as the actual dynamic API. A great benefit with it is
that there is no need to have special methods for getting keyword
arguments and documentation. It is also often practical that the only real
dynamic keywords need to be handled in :code:`__getattr__` and others
can be implemented directly in the main library class.

Because of the clear benefits and equal capabilities, the hybrid API
is in most cases a better alternative than the dynamic API when using
Python. One notable exception is implementing a library as a proxy for
an actual library implementation elsewhere, because then the actual
keyword must be executed elsewhere and the proxy can only pass forward
the keyword name and arguments.

A good example of using the hybrid API is Robot Framework's own
`Telnet library`_.

Using Robot Framework's internal modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test libraries implemented with Python can use Robot Framework's
internal modules, for example, to get information about the executed
tests and the settings that are used. This powerful mechanism to
communicate with the framework should be used with care, though,
because all Robot Framework's APIs are not meant to be used by
externally and they might change radically between different framework
versions.

The safest API to use are methods implementing keywords in the
BuiltIn_ library. Changes to keywords are rare and they are always
done so that old usage is first deprecated. One of the most useful
methods is :code:`replace_variables` which allows accessing currently
available variables. The following example demonstrates how to get
:var:`${OUTPUT_DIR}` which is one of the many handy `automatic
variables`_. It is also possible to set new variables from libraries
using :code:`set_test_variable`, :code:`set_suite_variable` and
:code:`set_global_variable`.

.. sourcecode:: python

   import os.path
   from robot.libraries.BuiltIn import BuiltIn

   def do_something(argument):
       output = do_something_that_creates_a_lot_of_output(argument)
       outputdir = BuiltIn().replace_variables('${OUTPUTDIR}')
       path = os.path.join(outputdir, 'results.txt')
       f = open(path, 'w')
       f.write(output)
       f.close()
       print '*HTML* Output written to <a href="results.txt">results.txt</a>'

The only catch with using methods from :code:`BuiltIn` is that all
:code:`run_keyword` method variants must be handled specially.
Methods that use :code:`run_keyword` methods have to be registered
as *run keywords* themselves using :code:`register_run_keyword`
method in :code:`BuiltIn` module. This method's documentation explains
why this needs to be done and obviously also how to do it.

The plan is to document all the internal modules better so that it is
easier to decide which can be used and how they should be used. If you
are unsure is using some API safe, please send a question to either
user or developer `mailing list`_.

Extending existing test libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains different approaches how to add new
functionality to existing test libraries and how to use them in your
own libraries otherwise.

Modifying original source code
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you have access to the source code of the library you want to
extend, you can naturally modify the source code directly. The biggest
problem of this approach is that it can be hard for you to update the
original library without affecting your changes. For users it may also
be confusing to use a library that has different functionality than
the original one. Repackaging the library may also be a big extra
task.

This approach works extremely well if the enhancements are generic and
you plan to submit them back to the original developers. If your
changes are applied to the original library, they are included in the
future releases and all the problems discussed above are mitigated. If
changes are non-generic, or you for some other reason cannot submit
them back, the approaches explained in the subsequent sections
probably work better.

Using inheritance
'''''''''''''''''

Another straightforward way to extend an existing library is using
inheritance. This is illustrated by the example below that adds new
:name:`Title Should Start With` keyword to the SeleniumLibrary_. This
example uses Python, but you can obviously extend an existing Java
library in Java code the same way.

.. sourcecode:: python

   from SeleniumLibrary import SeleniumLibrary

   class ExtendedSeleniumLibrary(SeleniumLibrary):

       def title_should_start_with(self, expected):
       	   title = self.get_title()
           if not title.startswith(expected):
               raise AssertionError("Title '%s' did not start with '%s'"
                                    % (title, expected))

A big difference with this approach compared to modifying the original
library is that the new library has a different name than the
original. A benefit is that you can easily tell that you are using a
custom library, but a big problem is that you cannot easily use the
new library with the original. First of all your new library will have
same keywords as the original meaning that there is always
conflict__. Another problem is that the libraries do not share their
state.

This approach works well when you start to use a new library and want
to add custom enhancements to it from the beginning. Otherwise other
mechanisms explained in this section are probably better.

__ `Handling keywords with same names`_

Using other libraries directly
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Because test libraries are technically just classes or modules, a
simple way to use another library is importing it and using its
methods. This approach works great when the methods are static and do
not depend on the library state. This is illustrated by the earlier
example that uses `Robot Framework's BuiltIn library`__.

If the library has state, however, things may not work as you would
hope.  The library instance you use in your library will not be the
same as the framework uses, and thus changes done by executed keywords
are not visible to your library. The next section explains how to get
an access to the same library instance that the framework uses.

__ `Using Robot Framework's internal modules`_

Getting active library instance from Robot Framework
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Robot Framework 2.5.2 added new BuiltIn_ keyword :name:`Get Library
Instance` that can be used to get the currently active library
instance from the framework itself. The library instance returned by
this keyword is the same as the framework itself uses, and thus
there is no problem seeing the correct library state. Although this
functionality is available as a keyword, it is typically used in test
libraries directly by importing the :name:`BuiltIn` library class `as
discussed earlier`__. The following example illustrates how to
implement the same :name:`Title Should Start With` keyword as in the
earlier example about `using inheritance`_.

__ `Using Robot Framework's internal modules`_

.. sourcecode:: python

   from robot.libraries.BuiltIn import BuiltIn

   def title_should_start_with(expected):
       seleniumlib = BuiltIn().get_library_instance('SeleniumLibrary')
       title = seleniumlib.get_title()
       if not title.startswith(expected):
           raise AssertionError("Title '%s' did not start with '%s'"
                                % (title, expected))

This approach is clearly better than importing the library directly
and using it when the library has a state. The biggest benefit over
inheritance is that you can use the original library normally and use
the new library in addition to it when needed. That is demonstrated in
the example below where the code from the previous examples is
expected to be available in a new library :name:`SeLibExtensions`.

Libraries using dynamic or hybrid API
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Test libraries that use the dynamic__ or `hybrid library API`_ often
have their own systems how to extend them. With these libraries you
need to ask guidance from the library developers or consult the
library documentation or source code.

__ `dynamic library API`_
