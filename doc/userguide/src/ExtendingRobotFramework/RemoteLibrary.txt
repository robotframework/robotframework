Remote library interface
------------------------

The remote library interface provides means for having test libraries
on different machines than where Robot Framework itself is running,
and also for implementing libraries using other languages than the
natively supported Python and Java. For a test library user remote
libraries look pretty much the same as any other test library, and
developing test libraries using the Remote library interface is also
very close to creating `normal test libraries`__.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two main reasons for using the remote library API:

* It is possible to have actual libraries on different machines than
  where Robot Framework is running. This allows interesting
  possibilities for distributed testing.

* Test libraries can be implemented using any language that support
  `XML-RPC`_ protocol. Robot Framework 2.1 contains generic `remote
  servers`__ for Python/Jython and Ruby, and the plan is to implement
  generic servers for other languages like Java and Perl in the future.

The remote library interface is provided by the Remote library that is
one of the `standard libraries`_ starting from Robot Framework
2.1. This library does not have any keywords of its own, but it works
as a proxy between the core framework and keywords implemented
elsewhere. The Remote library communicates with the actual library
implementation using a simple `remote protocol`_ on top of an
XML-RPC channel.  The high level architecture of all this is
illustrated in the picture below:

__ `Using remote servers`_


Taking Remote library into use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Importing Remote library
''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Remote library needs to know the address of the remote server but
otherwise importing it and using keywords that it provides is no
different to how other libraries are used. If you need to use the Remote
library multiple times in a test suite, or just want to give it a more
describing name, you cam to import it using the `WITH NAME syntax`_.

.. table:: Importing Remote library
   :class: example

   =========  ===========  ======================  =========  =========
    Setting      Value              Value            Value      Value
   =========  ===========  ======================  =========  =========
   Library    Remote       \http://localhost:8270  WITH NAME  Example1
   Library    Remote       \http://10.0.0.42:7777  WITH NAME  Example2
   =========  ===========  ======================  =========  =========

The URL used by the first example above is also the default address
that the Remote library uses if no address is given. Similarly port
:code:`8270` is the default port the provided remote servers use. (82
and 70 are the ASCII codes of letters `R` and `F`, respectively.)

Starting and stopping remote servers
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Before the Remote library can be imported using a certain URL, the
remote server providing the actual keywords must be started. It is
possible to start the server before launching the test execution, or
other keywords, for example from OperatingSystem or SSH library, can
start it up. Notice that in the latter case you may need to import the
Remote library `using Import Library keyword`_.

How a remote server can be stopped depends on how it is
implemented. Following methods work with the servers distributed with
Robot Framework:

* Regardless the actual library used, remote servers provide
  :name:`Stop Remote Servers` keyword that can be used from the test data.
* Remote servers have :code:`stop_remote_server` method in their
  XML-RPC interface.
* :code:`Ctrl-c` stops the server if it is running on a terminal
  window. Unfortunately this does not work with all servers on all
  operating systems.
* The server process can be terminated using tools provided by the
  operating system (e.g. :prog:`kill`).


Supported argument and return value types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the XML-RPC protocol does not support all possible object
types, the values transferred between the Remote library and remote
servers must be converted to compatible types. This applies to the
keyword arguments the Remote library passes to remote servers and to
the return values servers give back to the Remote library.

The conversions are done using following rules:

* Strings, numbers and Boolean values are passed without modifications.
* The :code:`None/nil` value is converted to an empty string.
* Lists (and tuples in Python) are passed as lists so that their contents
  are converted recursively.
* Dictionaries/maps are passed so that their values are converted
  to supported types recursively and keys are converted to strings.
* Other types are converted to strings.


Using remote servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework 2.1 includes remote server implementations written
both in Python and Ruby. These servers, as well as the example
libraries shown below and an example test case file, are
included in source distributions under :path:`tools/remoteserver`
directory and available also at
http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/RemoteLibrary.

The provided servers are designed so that it is easy to create test
libraries using them. With both of the servers the basic procedure is
as follows:

* Create a test library module or class similarly as a normal test
  library using the `static library API`_. With the Python server it
  is also possible to use the `hybrid library API`_.
* Import the remote server class and create an instance of it giving
  the library instance or module to it as an argument. The listening
  address and port, possibly got from the command line, can be given
  as optional arguments.

Both these steps can be done in the same module as illustrated by the
examples below. Executing these modules as scripts from the command
line will start the remote server so that it serves the keywords
implemented in the library.

Python remote library example
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This example demonstrates how to use the Python version of the
remote server. The example library implements keywords :name:`Count
Items In Directory` and :name:`Strings Should Be Equal`. 

.. sourcecode:: python 

   ../../tools/remoteserver/example/examplelibrary.py

Ruby remote library example
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This example uses the Ruby remote server and provides exactly same
keywords as the previous Python example:

.. sourcecode:: ruby 

   ../../tools/remoteserver/example/examplelibrary.rb


Remote protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains the protocol that is used between the Remote
library and remote servers. This information is mainly targeted for
people who want to create new remote servers. The provided Python and
Ruby servers can also be used as examples.

The remote protocol is implemented on top of `XML-RPC`_, which is a
simple remote procedure call protocol using XML over HTTP. Most
mainstream languages (Python, Java, C, Ruby, Perl, Javascript, PHP,
...) have a support for XML-RPC either built-in or as extensions.

Required methods
''''''''''''''''

A remote server is an XML-RPC server that must have the same methods
in its public interface as the `dynamic library API`_ has. Only
:code:`get_keyword_names` and :code:`run_keyword` are actually
required, but :code:`get_keyword_arguments` and
:code:`get_keyword_documentation` are also recommended. Notice that
using camelCase format in method names is not possible currently. How
the actual keywords are implemented is not relevant for the Remote
library.  A remote server can either act as a wrapper for real test
libraries, like the provided Python and Ruby servers do, or it can
implement keywords itself.

Remote servers should also have :code:`stop_remote_server` method in
their public interface. Additionally they should provide it as a
keyword so that it can be used in the test data.

Getting remote keyword names and other information
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Remote library gets a list of keywords that the remote server
provides using :code:`get_keyword_names` method. This method must
return the keyword names as a list of strings.

Remote servers can, and should, also implement
:code:`get_keyword_arguments` and :code:`get_keyword_documentation`
methods to provide more information about the keywords. Both of these
keywords get the name of the keyword as an argument. Arguments must be
returned as a list of strings in the `same format as with dynamic
libraries`__, and documentation must be returned `as a string`__.

Executing remote keywords
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

When the Remote library wants the server to execute some keyword, it
calls remote server's :code:`run_keyword` method and passes it the
keyword name and a list of arguments. Base types can be used as
arguments directly but more complex types are `converted to supported
types`__. The server must return results of the execution in a result
dictionary (or map, depending on terminology) containing items
explained in the following table.
