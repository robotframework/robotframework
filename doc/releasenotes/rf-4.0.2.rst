Most important enhancements
===========================

Fix using using `Union` containing generics as type hint
--------------------------------------------------------

`Robot Framework 4.0.1`_ fine-tuned how using Union__ as type hint used in
automatic argument conversion works. Changes themselves were fine, but they
introduced a regression (`#3931`_) making it impossible to use `Union` containing
`subscribed generics`__ such as:

.. code:: python

    def example(arg: Union[List[int], Dict[str, int]]):
        # ...
