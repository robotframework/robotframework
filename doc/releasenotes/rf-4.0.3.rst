Most important enhancements
===========================

Regression using `TypedDict` as type hint
-----------------------------------------

Robot Framework 4.0.1 changed how `Union` used as a type hint works (`#3897`__).
The change itself was valid, but it unfortunately introduced a regression making
it impossible to use `Union` containing `TypedDict` or subscribed generics
(e.g. `List[int]`) as a type hint. The latter problem with generics was fixed in
Robot Framework 4.0.2 (`#3931`__), but that change very unfortunately made the
problem with `TypedDict` even worse and made it impossible to use them as type
hints at all.

Robot Framework 4.0.3 fixes the problem with `TypedDict` with and without `Union`
(`#3969`_). The fix is generic and should prevent this kind of problems occurring
also with other types. Hopefully the saga with `Union` as type hint now finally ends.
