Most important enhancements
===========================

Libdoc enhancements
-------------------

Libdoc's HTML output has been enhanced in several ways:

- Keyword arguments are split to separate lines to make them easier to read especially when there are
  lot of arguments or arguments have type information or default values. (`#3639`_)

- If argument type is an enumeration__, its members are shown automatically in arguments. This
  helps, for example, with the Browser__ library that uses enumerations extensively. (`#3637`_)

- Shortcuts to keywords can be shown in expanded list in addition to the old compact style.
  (`#3635`_)

- Libdoc once again works if the original source of the keyword cannot be found. (`#3587`_)

To see actual examples of the enhancements, see the documentation for Browser__ and
SeleniumLibrary__.

Python 3.9 support
------------------

Although `Python 3.9`__ has not yet been officially released, Robot Framework 3.2.2 was tested using
its beta releases. Bugs affecting the XML library (`#3627`_) and line number detection of imported
libraries (`#3628`_) were fixed and Python 3.9 was also added to our CI. (`#3629`_)

for your continued support!

We have also had several great contributions by the open source community:

- `willemvanoort <https://github.com/willemvanoort>`__ enhanced type conversions with enums
  to work with normalized member names (`#3611`_)

- `Rudolf-AT <https://github.com/Rudolf-AT>`__ proposed enhancing Libdoc to allow switching between
  compact and expanded list of shortcuts and also implemented the functionality (`#3635`_)

- `Kerkko Pelttari <https://github.com/xylix>`__ changed Libdoc to show arguments on own lines (`#3639`_)

- `Dirk Richter <https://github.com/DirkRichter>`__ fixed problems with `--expandkeywords` (`#3585`_)

- `Jeroen <https://github.com/jeroen1602>`__ updated documentation to use the new `FOR/END` loop
