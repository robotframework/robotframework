Most important enhancements
===========================

Continue-on-failure mode can be controlled using tags
-----------------------------------------------------

Robot Framework has for long time had so called "continuable failures" that fail
the test case but allow execution to continue after the failure. Earlier this
functionality could only be enabled by library keywords using special exceptions
and by using BuiltIn keyword `Run Keyword And Continue On Failure`.

Robot Framework 4.1 eases using the continue-on-failure mode considerably by
allowing tests and keywords to use special tags to initiate it. The new
`robot:continue-on-failure` tag enables the mode so that if any of the executed
keywords fail, the next keyword is nevertheless executed. This mode does not
propagate to lower level keywords, though, so in them execution stops
immediately and is resumed only on the test or keyword with the special tag.
If recursive mode is desired, it is possible to use another new tag
`robot:recursive-continue-on-failure` to enable it. (`#2285`_)

Argument conversion enhancements
--------------------------------

Automatic argument conversion has been improved in few different ways:

- `Derived enumerations`__ `IntEnum` and `IntFlag` are now supported. With both
  of them the value that is used can be a member name, like with other
  enumerations, or the integer value of the member. (`#3910`_)

- Number conversions (`int`, `float` and `Decimal`) support spaces and
  underscores as number separators like `2 000 000`. (`#4026`_)

- Integer conversion supports hexadecimal, octal and binary values using
  `0x`, `Oo` and `0b` prefixes, respectively. For example, `0xAA`, `0o252`,
  and `0b 1010 1010` are alternative ways to specify integer `170`. (`#3909`_)

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

Robot Framework 4.1 is mostly backwards compatible with Robot Framework 4.0.
There are, however, few changes that may affect some users:

- If `--doc` or `--metadata` gets a value that points to an existing file,
  the actual value is read from that file, but with earlier versions the value
  is the path itself. It is rather unlikely that anyone has used this kind of
  documentation, but with metadata paths are possible. If a path to an existing
  file should be used as an actual value, the value should get some extra
  content to avoid the path to be recognized. Even a single space like
  `--metadata "Example: file.txt"` is enough. (`#4008`_)

- String library methods `should_be_uppercase` and `should_be_lowercase` have
  been renamed to `should_be_upper_case` and `should_be_lower_case`, respectively.
  Due to Robot Framework's keyword matching being underscore insensitive, this
  change does not affect normal usage of these keywords. If someone has used
  these methods programmatically, they need to update their code. (`#3890`_)

In addition to the changes explained above, any change to the code may
`affect someones workflow`__. It is thus a good idea to test new versions
before using them in production.

Deprecated features
===================

Python 2 support
----------------

Robot Framework 4.1 is the last release supporting Python 2. Its possible bug
fix releases like 4.1.1 will still support Python 2, but the forthcoming
Robot Framework 5.0 will require Python 3.6 or newer. (`#3457`__)

This unfortunately means that also Jython__ and IronPython__ support is deprecated.
Support can be added again if these projects get Python 3.6+ compatible versions
released.

Built-in Tidy
-------------

The built-in Tidy tool has been deprecated in favor of the externally developed
and much more powerful RoboTidy__ tool. The built-in Tidy will be removed altogether
in Robot Framework 5.0. (`#4004`_)

Acknowledgements
================

Robot Framework 4.1 development has been sponsored by the `Robot Framework Foundation`_
and its `close to 50 member organizations <https://robotframework.org/foundation/#members>`_.
In addition to that, we have got great contributions by the open source community:

- `Oliver Boehmer <https://github.com/oboehmer>`_ added support to control
  the continue-on-failure mode using test and keyword tags (`#2285`_).

- `Oliver Schwaneberg <https://github.com/Schwaneberg>`_ enhanced
  `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` to support strict retry interval (`#3209`_).

- `Sergey Tupikov <https://github.com/vokiput>`_ added support to collapse
  whitespace with `Should Be Equal` and other comparison keywords (`#3884`_).

- `Mikhail Tuev <https://github.com/miktuy>`_ fixed using `--removekeywords` when
  test contains IF structure (`#4009`_) and renamed String library methods for
  consistency (`#3890`_).

- `Vinay Vennela <https://github.com/vinayvennela>`_ enhanced the dry-run mode
  to allow modifying tags using `Set Tags` and `Remove Tags` keywords (`#3985`_).

- `@asonkeri <https://github.com/asonkeri>`_ fixed keyword documentation
  scrollbar issues in Libdoc HTML output (`#4012`_).

Huge thanks to all sponsors, contributors and to everyone else who has reported
problems, participated in discussions on various forums, or otherwise helped to make
Robot Framework and its community and ecosystem better.
