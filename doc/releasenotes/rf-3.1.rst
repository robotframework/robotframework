===================
Robot Framework 3.1
===================


.. default-role:: code

`Robot Framework`_ 3.1 is a new major release with Robotic Process Automation
(RPA) support, automatic argument type conversion, support for named-only
arguments, for loop enhancements, fix for intermittent corruption of
`output.xml` files when using timeouts, and several other interesting new
features and as various bug fixes. It also starts the deprecation process to
remove the support of using test data in HTML format and making test data
parsing more strict also otherwise.

Questions and comments related to the release can be sent to the
`robotframework-users`_ mailing list or to `Robot Framework Slack`_,
and possible bugs submitted to the `issue tracker`_.

If you have pip_ installed, just run

Most important enhancements
===========================

.. _rpa support:

Terminology configuration to support Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

`Robotic Process Automation (RPA)`__ means automating business processes that
typically have been designed for humans and thus involve a lot of GUIs. As
an automation tool Robot Framework has always supported this kind of usage,
but it has been a bit awkward to create test cases when not actually
automating tests.

Robot Framework 3.1 is taking the first steps to make Robot Framework
a proper RPA tool by allowing creation of *tasks* instead of *tests* and
changing terminology in reports and logs when tasks are executed (`#2788`_).
There are two ways to activate the RPA mode:

1. Use the new `*** Tasks ***` (or `*** Task ***`) header in data instead
   of the normal `*** Test Cases ***` header. This is useful when it
   is important that data contains tasks, not tests. It is an error to run
   multiple files together so that some have tasks and others have tests.

2. Use the new `--rpa` command line option. This is convenient when executing
   data that needs to be compatible with earlier Robot Framework versions
   and when using editors that do not support the new `*** Tasks ***` header.
   Also Rebot supports the `--rpa` option, so it is possible to execute tests
   as earlier and only create reports and logs using the `--rpa` option.

Regardless how the RPA mode is enabled, the generated reports and logs use
term "task", not "test".

As a convenience, a new command line option `--task` has been added as an
alias for the existing `--test` option. It is also possible to use
`Task Setup`, `Task Teardown`, `Task Template` and `Task Timeout` settings
instead of `Test Setup/Teardown/Template/Timeout`, and additionally
`Set Task Variable` keyword can be used instead of `Set Test Variable`.

Development related to the RPA support has been separately sponsored by
`Siili <https://www.siili.com/>`__, `Knowit <https://www.knowit.fi/>`__,
`Vala <https://www.valagroup.com/>`__, `Qentinel <https://qentinel.com/>`__
and `Eficode <https://www.eficode.com/home>`__. For more information about
Robot Framework and RPA see http://robotframework.org/rpa.

Automatic argument conversion
-----------------------------

By default all arguments that are not specified as variables are given to
Python based keywords as Unicode strings. This includes cases like this:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

  *** Test Cases ***
  Example
      Example Keyword    42    False

Starting from Robot Framework 3.1, it is possible to specify argument types
when implementing keywords using few different approaches, and Robot Framework
then converts arguments to the specified types automatically.

When using Python 3, it is possible to use `function annotations`__ to
explicitly specify types (`#2890`_):

.. sourcecode:: python

  def example_keyword(count: int, case_insensitive: bool = True):
      if case_insensitive:
          # ...

An alternative way to explicitly specify types is using the `@keyword`
decorator (`#2947`_) that works also with Python 2. It is possible both
to map argument names to types using a dictionary and to use a list mapping
arguments to types based on position:

.. sourcecode:: python

  @keyword(types={'count': int, 'case_insensitive': bool})
  def example_keyword(count, case_insensitive=True):
      if case_insensitive:
          # ...

  @keyword(types=[int, bool])
  def example_keyword(count, case_insensitive=True):
      if case_insensitive:
          # ...

If an argument has no explicit type specified, Robot Framework still tries
to get the type implicitly from an argument default values (`#2932`_):

.. sourcecode:: python

  def example_keyword(count=-1, case_insensitive=True):
      if case_insensitive:
          # ...

Automatic argument conversion is also supported by the dynamic library
interface (`#2068`_) and the remote interface (`#3008`_) via new
`get_keyword_types` method. Remote server authors are suggested to add this
new method to their server implementations to make the new functionality
available for their users.

__ https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/

Named-only arguments support
----------------------------

Python 3 supports so called `keyword-only arguments`__ and Robot Framework
3.1 supports the same approach but uses the term *named-only arguments*.
The new syntax can be used with Python 3 based test libraries (`#2555`_),
user keywords (`#2896`_), and dynamic libraries (`#2897`_).

With Python 3 libraries this syntax could be used, for example, like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

  def sort_words(*words, case_sensitive=False):
      key = str.lower if case_sensitive else None
      return sorted(words, key=key)

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

 *** Test Cases ***
 Example
     Sort Words    Foo    bar    baZ
     Sort Words    Foo    bar    baZ    case_sensitive=True

User keywords using the new syntax could look like this:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

 *** Keywords ***
 With Varargs
     [Arguments]    @{varargs}    ${named}
     Log Many    @{varargs}    ${named}

 Without Varargs
     [Arguments]    @{}    ${first}    ${second}=default
     Log Many    ${first}    ${second}

Fix for intermittent corrupted outputs when using timeouts
----------------------------------------------------------

There have now and then been reports about `output.xml` files being corrupted
and preventing log and report generation. Such problems are typically very
hard to reproduce and they may be due to bugs in Robot Framework itself or
in libraries/tools used with it. Issue `#2839`_ demonstrated that this can
happen when using Robot Framework's own test and keyword timeouts, if
keywords log using the programmatic logging interface. That particular
problem is now fixed.

Installation enhancements
-------------------------

There are various enhancements and other changes related to installation:

- The `robot` and `rebot` start-up scripts are nowadays `*.exe` files on
  Windows. They used to be `*.bat` files which caused all kinds of bigger
  and smaller issues. (`#2415`_)

- Robot Framework is now distributed as a `wheel <http://pythonwheels.com>`_
  distribution making installation faster. (`#1734`_)

- Source distribution format has been changed from tar.gz to zip. (`#2830`_)

- Old `pybot`, `jybot`, `ipybot`, `jyrebot` and `ipyrebot` start-up scripts
  have been removed. (`#2818`_)

For loop enhancements
---------------------

The for loop syntax has got several enhancements:

- The most noticeable change is that loops nowadays end with an explicit
  `END` marker on its own row and keywords inside the loop do not need to
  be escaped with a backslash. (`#3009`_)

- Another visible change is that the for loop marker used to be `:FOR`
  (case-insensitive) when nowadays just `FOR` (case-sensitive) is enough.
  (`#2990`_)

- Also the for loop separators `IN`, `IN RANGE`, `IN ENUMERATE` and `IN ZIP`
  were changed to be both case- and space-sensitive. (`#2991`_)

As a result of these changes, for loops can now be written like this::

   FOR    ${animal}    IN    cat    dog    cow
       Keyword    ${animal}
       Another keyword
   END

This is a big improvement compared to the old syntax::

   :FOR    ${animal}    IN    cat    dog    cow
   \    Keyword    ${animal}
   \    Another keyword

These changes pave the way for possible future syntax enhancements like
support for `IF/ELSE` and `TRY/EXCEPT` structures as well as allowing
nested control structures.

The old for loop syntax still works in Robot Framework 3.1 without visible
deprecation warnings, but the plan is to deprecate it already in Robot
Framework 3.2 to make it possible to introduce new syntax in Robot Framework
3.3. Users are advised to switch to the new syntax as soon as possible.

Accessing nested list and dictionary variable items
---------------------------------------------------

There has been a syntax to access items of variables containing lists
or dictionaries, but this syntax has only supported accessing direct
items, not possible nested items. This limitation has now been lifted
by issue `#2601`_ and it is possible to use syntax like `${var}[key][0]`
to access as deeply nested items as needed. This is useful, for example,
when working with JSON objects typically used with REST interfaces.

Notice that at the same time the general item access syntax has changed
to use style `${var}[0]` and `${var}[key]` regardless is the variable
a list or dictionary. The old syntax `@{var}[0]` and `&{var}[key]` still
works but it will be `deprecated in the future`__.

__ https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2974

New `*.resource` extension for resource files
---------------------------------------------

Resource files can now have a dedicated `*.resource` extension, for example
`login.resource`, to differentiate them from `*.robot` files containing
test cases (`#2891`_). The `*.robot` extension continues to work with
resource files as well and there are no plans to deprecate it.

Better error reporting when test data is invalid
------------------------------------------------

There is now an explicit error in these cases where errors have earlier been
silently ignored:

- If parsing a file fails when executing a directory. (`#2857`_)
- If test data contains unrecognized section header. (`#2860`_)

Better compatibility with third party tools consuming xUnit outputs
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Robot Framework's xUnit compatible output files created with the `--xunit`
command line option were not compatible with tooling that was more strict
about the xUnit file format. This is mainly due to the format not being
officially standardized, but nowadays Robot's xUnit outputs use a format that
ought to be compatible with all or at least most tools. See `#2978`_
for more information.

No need to install external ElementTree module with IronPython 2.7.9+
---------------------------------------------------------------------

IronPython 2.7.9 finally contains a `working ElementTree implementation`__.
Robot Framework 3.1 uses the standard ElementTree with IronPython 2.7.9+
(`#2954`_) and there is no need to install an external ElementTree module
anymore.

__ https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython2/issues/370

Generating documentation for Java based libraries works without `tools.jar` with Java 9+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier Libdoc always required the `tools.jar` package when creating
documentation for Java based libraries. This package used to be part of
the Java SDK but it was removed in Java 9. At the same time Java got new
standard modules that support same functionality, and now Libdoc has been
enhanced to not need `tools.jar` with Java 9 and newer. (`#2854`_)

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

Python 2.6 and 3.3 are not supported anymore
--------------------------------------------

Neither Python 2.6 nor Python 3.3 are supported anymore. Both Python versions
have reached their end-of-life, the former already in 2013. (`#2276`_)

Old start-up scripts like `pybot` are removed
---------------------------------------------

Old start-up scripts `pybot`, `jybot`, `ipybot`, `jyrebot` and `ipyrebot`
have been removed in favor of the generic `robot` and `rebot` scripts
introduced in Robot Framework 3.0. (`#2818`_)

Changes to pattern matching syntax
----------------------------------

Robot Framework supports pattern matching using `glob-like patterns`__
in various places. This includes command line options like `--test` and
`--include` and keywords like `Should (Not) Match`, `Run Keyword And Expect
Error`, and various `Match` keywords in the XML library.

Starting from Robot Framework 3.1, these patterns support using `[chars]`
as a pattern matching any character inside the brackets (`#2471`_). This is
a useful enhancement, but also means that square brackets are considered
special and existing patterns using them as literal characters are affected.

A simple fix to possible problems is replacing brackets with a question
mark (`?`) which matches any single character. `Run Keyword And Expect Error`
also got a new feature making it possible to use, for example, exact match
in addition to glob pattern matching (`#2967`_).

Pattern matching also had a bug that a trailing newline in the matched
strings was ignored (`#2894`_). For example, `foobar\n` was earlier
considered to match both `*bar` and `foobar`. After this bug being fixed
pattern matching is more strict and trailing newlines need to be added to
matched strings if they are missing.

__ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)

Square brackets after variable like `${var}[xxx]` is considered item access
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax like `${var}[xxx]` is now considered variable item access (`#2601`_),
not variable `${var}` followed by a literal string `[xxx]`. If the latter
is desired, escaping like `${var}\[xxx]` is needed.

Underscores are not converted to spaces in values given from the command line
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier underscores were automatically converted to spaces with command line
options `--name`, `--doc`, `--metadata`, `--tagdoc`, `--tagstatcombine`,
`--logtitle` and `--reporttitle`. For example, `--doc Underscores_used_here`
was interpreted as `Underscores used here`, but nowadays the value is used
as-is. A simple fix is quoting or escaping spaces on the command line like
`--doc "We got spaces"` or `--doc We\ got\ spaces`. (`#2399`_)

Changes to xUnit output file format
-----------------------------------

Third party tools consuming xUnit compatible XML files earlier supported
both `skip` and `skipped` attribute when reporting the number of skipped
tests, but nowadays many tools are stricter and only support `skipped`.
Previous Robot Framework versions used `skip`, but it has now been changed
to `skipped` to fix compatibility with the more strict tools (`#2978`_).
This obviously affects possible tools that expect the attribute to be `skip`
but they ought to be rare. If such tool turn out to be common and not easy
to update, we can consider making the attribute name configurable.

Times in xUnit outputs are floats when they used to be integers (`#2397`).
This should not cause problems with 3rd party tools because they generally
parse times as floats, but custom tools parsing times as integers using
`int()` or equivalent need to be updated.

`time` attribute was added also to the `<testsuite>` element (`#2979`_).
Third party tools ought to handle this common optional attribute just fine,
but some overly strict custom tool may still be affected and needs to be
fixed.

Logs and reports do not support IE 8 and other old browsers anymore
-------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript dependencies used internally by logs and reports have been
updated. This may cause problems with ancient browsers, and most notably
IE 8 is not supported anymore. (`#2419`_)

Newline handling changed with `Create File` and `Append To File` on Windows
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier `Create File` and `Append To File` did not convert the newline
character (`\n`) to the native Windows newline character combination (`\r\n`).
Most Windows tools handle both kind of newlines, but if it was necessary to
use actual Windows newlines, then literal `\r\n` or operating system dependent
automatic variable `${\n}` needed to be used.

This was accidentally changed in RF 3.1 (`#3097`_) so that nowadays `\n` will
automatically be converted to `\r\n` on Windows. Although this was accidental,
the behavior is more convenient and it was decided not to be changed back.
This is also how Python (and most other programing languages) handle newlines.

Some deprecated syntax removed
------------------------------

Syntax that has been deprecated earlier has now been removed altogether:

- `*** Metadata ***` and `*** User Keywords ***` headers do not anymore work
  as synonyms for `*** Settings ***` and `*** Keywords ***`, respectively.
  (`#2864`_)

- `Document` cannot be used as a synonym for the `Documentation` setting.
  (`#2865`_)

- `Pre Condition` and `Post Condition` do not anymore work as synonyms for
  `Setup` and `Teardown`, respectively. (`#2865`_)

- It is not anymore possible to import a library with an extra space in its
  name like `Selenium Library`. (`#2879`_)

- Giving an alias to an imported library requires using `WITH NAME` with
  all uppercase letters. (`#2880`_)

Other issues possibly causing backwards incompatibility problems
----------------------------------------------------------------

- First logical, not physical, line of the keyword documentation is included
  in log files. (`#2491`_)

- Test libraries using the dynamic library API get all named arguments as
  part of `kwargs` (when their `run_keyword` accepts it), not mapped to
  positional arguments. (`#2930`_)

- `Run Keyword And Ignore Error` and others similar keywords let "passing
  exceptions" caused by `Pass Execution` and similar keywords to go through.
  (`#2799`_)

- `robot-exit` tag that is added automatically to tests if execution is stopped
  gracefully has been renamed to `robot:exit`. (`#2539`_)

- `Collections` keywords cannot anymore be used with strings. (`#2580`_)

- `FOR` alone, case-sensitively, is enough to start a for loop (`#2990`_).
  This may cause problems if a keyword is named `FOR` or when using templates
  and a data item is exactly `FOR`. In the former case a workaround is using
  the keyword like `For`, and in the latter case the value needs to be escaped
  like `\FOR`.

- Timer string format is more strict. For example, `01:02:03:123` and
  `01:02foo` do not work anymore. (`#2921`_)

- Deprecated `robot.running.TestSuite.(imports|variables|user_keywords)`
  properties have been removed from the programmatic API. (`#2867`_)

Deprecated features
===================

HTML and TSV data formats have been deprecated
----------------------------------------------

The HTML format has been deprecated for good and it will not be supported
by future Robot Framework versions at all. The TSV format has been
deprecated as well, but it can be used if the data is fully compatible with
the plain text format and the `--extension` option is used to tell that TSV
files should be parsed. It is possible to use, for example, `--extension tsv`
(`*.tsv` only) or `--extension robot:tsv` (`*.robot` and `*.tsv`). (`#2819`_)

Parsing other than `*.robot` files by default is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------------------

The plan is that Robot Framework 3.2 would parse only files with the
`*.robot` extension by default, but the `--extension` option could be used
to tell that also some other files should be parsed. The first step towards
that goal is deprecating parsing other than `*.robot` files by default in
Robot Framework 3.1. This naturally includes HTML and TSV files that are
deprecated in general (see above), but also the otherwise supported plain
text test data in normal text files (`*.txt`) and embedded into
reStructuredText files (`*.rst` or `*.rest`). (`#2820`_)

Use the `--extension` option like `--extension rst` (`.rst` only) or
`--extension robot:rst:rest` (`*.robot`, `*.rst` and `*.rest`) to avoid
the deprecation warning and to get these files parsed also in the future.

For loop syntax changes
-----------------------

As discussed above, `for loop syntax has been enhanced`__ heavily, and the
plan is to deprecate and remove the old syntax pretty quickly. The old
syntax still works in Robot Framework 3.1 and for most parts is not
deprecated yet. Users are nevertheless advised to switch to the new syntax
as soon as possible.

__ `For loop enhancements`_

List item access to be changed to use syntax `${var}[item]`
-----------------------------------------------------------

Issue `#2601`_ introduces syntax like `${var}[key][0]` to access nested
items in variables containing lists and dictionaries, and also makes
it possible to access direct items like `${var}[0]` and `${var}[key]`
regardless is the variable a list or dictionary. The old syntax `@{var}[0]`
and `&{var}[key]` still works, but it will be `deprecated in the future`__.
Using solely the new syntax is highly recommend already now.

__ https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2974

Using section and setting names space-insensitively is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier it has been possible to use internal spaces freely in section headers
like `*** S e t t i n g s ***` and in settings like `Testsetup` or
`[ S e t u p ]`. This is now deprecated and formats like `*** Settings ***`,
`Test Setup` and `[Setup]` needs to be used. All names are still
case-insensitive, though, and a space can be used around the name
and a possible surrounding marker meaning that also `***Settings***` and
`[ Setup ]` are accepted. (`#2985`_)

Escaping problematic characters with `--escape` is deprecated
-------------------------------------------------------------

Robot Framework's custom `--escape` functionality has been deprecated
and normal command line escaping mechanism needs to be used instead.
Typically values can be quoted like `-v "VAR:Value with spaces"`, but
depending on the context and the terminal using the backslash character
may work as well. (`#2846`_)

`--warnonskippedfiles` has been deprecated
------------------------------------------

The `--warnonskippedfiles` option has made it possible to explicitly show
if certain files are skipped because they cannot be parsed successfully.
Because such problems are nowadays reported as explicit errors (`#2857`_),
the `--warnonskippedfiles` option is not useful anymore and it has been
deprecated.
