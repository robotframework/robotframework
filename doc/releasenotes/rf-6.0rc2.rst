=======================================
Robot Framework 6.0 release candidate 2
=======================================

.. default-role:: code

`Robot Framework`_ 6.0 is a new major release that starts Robot Framework's
localization efforts. In addition to that, it contains several nice enhancements
related to, for example, automatic argument conversion and using embedded arguments.
Robot Framework 6.0 rc 2 is the second and hopefully the last release candidate
containing all features and fixes planned to be included in the final release.

Robot Framework 6.0 was initially labeled Robot Framework 5.1 and considered
a feature release. In the end it grow so big that we decided to make it a major
release instead.

Questions and comments related to the release can be sent to the
`robotframework-users`_ mailing list or to `Robot Framework Slack`_,
and possible bugs submitted to the `issue tracker`_.

If you have pip_ installed, just run


::

   pip install --pre --upgrade robotframework

to install the latest available release or use

::

   pip install robotframework==6.0rc2

to install exactly this version. Alternatively you can download the source
distribution from PyPI_ and install it manually. For more details and other
installation approaches, see the `installation instructions`_.

Robot Framework 6.0 rc 2 was released on Tuesday October 11, 2022.
The first release candidate did not contain problems preventing the final
release, but we wanted to add few features that make IDE integration easier
and a new release candidate was needed. The final release is planned to be
released on Tuesday October 18, 2022.

Most important enhancements
===========================

Localization
------------

Robot Framework 6.0 starts our localization efforts by making it possible to translate
various markers used in the data. It is possible to translate headers (e.g. `Test Cases`)
and settings (e.g. `Documentation`) (`#4096`_), `Given/When/Then` prefixes used in BDD
(`#519`_), as well as true and false strings used in Boolean argument conversion (`#4400`_).
Future versions may allow translating syntax like `IF` and `FOR`, contents of logs and
reports, error messages, and so on.

Languages to use are specified when starting execution using the `--language` command
line option. With languages supported by Robot Framework out-of-the-box, it is possible
to use just a language code or name like `--language fi` or `--language Finnish`.
It is also possible to create a custom language file and use it like `--language MyLang.py`.
If there is a need to support multiple languages, the `--language` option can be
used multiple times like `--language de --language uk`.

In addition to specifying the language from the command line, it is possible to
specify it in the data file itself using `language: <lang>` syntax, where `<lang>` is
a language code or name, before the first section::

    language: fi

    *** Asetukset ***
    Dokumentaatio        Example using Finnish.

Due to technical reasons this per-file language configuration affects also parsing
subsequent files, but that behavior is likely to change and *should not* be dependent
on. Either use `language: <lang>` in each parsed file or specify the language to
use from the command line.

Robot Framework 6.0 contains built-in support for these languages in addition
to English that is automatically supported:

- Bosnian (bs)
- Bulgarian (bg)
- Chinese Simplified (zh-CN) and Chinese Traditional (zh-TW)
- Czech (cs)
- Dutch (nl)
- Finnish (fi)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Hindi (hi)
- Italian (it)
- Polish (pl)
- Portuguese (pt) and Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)
- Romanian (ro)
- Russian (ru)
- Spanish (es)
- Swedish (sv)
- Thai (th)
- Turkish (tr)
- Ukrainian (uk)

All these translations have been provided by our awesome community and we hope to get
more community contributed translations in future releases. If you are interested to
help, head to Crowdin__ that we use for collaboration. For more instructions see
issue `#4390`_ and for general discussion and questions join the `#localization`
channel on our Slack_.

Enhancements to using keywords with embedded arguments
------------------------------------------------------

When using keywords with embedded arguments, it is pretty common that a keyword
that is used matches multiple keyword implementations. For example,
`Execute "ls" with "-lh"` in this example matches both of the keywords:

.. sourcecode:: robotframework

   *** Test Cases ***
   Automatic conflict resolution
       Execute "ls"
       Execute "ls" with "-lh"

   *** Keywords ***
   Execute "${cmd}"
       Log    Running command '${cmd}'.

   Execute "${cmd}" with "${opts}"
       Log    Running command '${cmd}' with options '${opts}'.

Earlier when such conflicts occurred, execution failed due to there being
multiple matching keywords. Nowadays, if there is a match that is better than
others, it will be used and the conflict is resolved. In the above example,
`Execute "${cmd}" with "${opts}"` is considered to be a better match than
the more generic `Execute "${cmd}"` and the example thus succeeds. (`#4454`_)

There can, however, be cases where it is not possible to find a single best
match. In such cases conflicts cannot be resolved automatically and
execution fails as earlier.

Another nice enhancement related to keywords using embedded arguments is that
if they are used with `Run Keyword` or its variants, arguments are not anymore
always converted to strings. That allows passing arguments containing other
values than strings as variables also in this context. (`#1595`_)

Enhancements to automatic argument conversion
---------------------------------------------

Automatic argument conversion makes it possible for library authors to specify
what types certain arguments have and then Robot Framework automatically converts
used arguments accordingly. This support has been enhanced in various ways.

Nowadays, if a container type like `list` is used with parameters like `list[int]`,
arguments are not only converted to the container type, but items they contain are
also converted to specified nested types (`#4433`_). This works with all containers
Robot Framework's argument conversion works in general. Most important examples
are the already mentioned lists, dictionaries like `dict[str, int]`, tuples like
`tuple[str, int, bool]` and heterogeneous tuples like `tuple[int, ...]`. Notice
that using parameters with Python's standard types `requires Python 3.9`__. With
earlier versions it is possible to use `List`, `Dict` and other such types
available in the typing__ module.

Another container type that is nowadays handled better is TypedDict__. Earlier,
when TypedDicts were used as type hints, arguments were only converted to
dictionaries, but nowadays items are converted according to the specified
types. In addition to that, Robot Framework validates that all the specified
items are present. (`#4477`_)

A bit smaller but still nice enhancement is that automatic conversion nowadays
works also with `pathlib.Path`__. (`#4461`_)

__ https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html
__ https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict
__ https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html

Enhancements for setting keyword and test tags
----------------------------------------------

It is now possible to set tags for all keywords in a certain file by using
the new `Keyword Tags` setting (`#4373`_). It works in resource files and also
in test case and suite initialization files. When used in initialization files,
it only affects keywords in that file and does not propagate to lower level suites.

The `Force Tags` setting has been renamed to `Test Tags` (`#4368`_). The motivation
is to make settings related to tests more consistent (`Test Setup`, `Test Timeout`,
`Test Tags`, ...) and to better separate settings for specifying test and keyword tags.
Consistent naming also easies translations. The old `Force Tags` setting still works but it
will be `deprecated in the future`__. When creating tasks, it is possible to use
`Task Tags` alias instead of `Test Tags`.

To simplify setting tags, the `Default Tags` setting will `also be deprecated`__.
The functionality it provides, setting tags that some but no all tests get,
will be enabled in the future by using `-tag` syntax with the `[Tags]` setting
to indicate that a test should not get tag `tag`. This syntax will then work
also in combination with the new `Keyword Tags`. For more details see `#4374`__.

Enhancements to keyword namespaces
----------------------------------

It is possible to mark keywords in resource files as private by adding
`robot:private` tag to them (`#430`_). If such a keyword is used by keywords
outside that resource file, there will be a warning. These keywords are also
excluded from HTML library documentation generated by Libdoc.

If a keyword exists in the same resource file as a keyword using it, it will
be used even if there would be keyword with the same name in another resource
file (`#4366`_). Earlier this situation caused a conflict.

If a keyword exists in the same resource file as a keyword using it and there
is a keyword with the same name in the test case file, the keyword in the test
case file will be used as it has been used earlier. This behavior is nowadays
deprecated__, though, and in the future local keywords will have precedence also
in these cases.

__ `Keywords in test case files having precedence over local keywords in resource files`_

Possibility to disable continue-on-failure mode
-----------------------------------------------

Robot Framework generally stops executing a keyword or a test case if there
is a failure. Exceptions to this rule include teardowns, templates and
cases where the continue-on-failure mode has been explicitly enabled with
`robot:continue-on-failure` or `robot:recursive-continue-on-failure`
tags. Robot Framework 6.0 makes it possible to disable the implicit or explicit
continue-on-failure mode when needed by using `robot:stop-on-failure` and
`robot:recursive-stop-on-failure` tags (`#4303`_).

`start/end_keyword` listener methods get more information about control structures
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using the listener API v2, `start_keyword` and `end_keyword` methods are not
only used with keywords but also with all control structures. Earlier these methods
always got exactly the same information, but nowadays there is additional context
specific details with control structures. (`#4335`_)

Libdoc enhancements
-------------------

Libdoc can now generate keyword documentation not only for libraries and
resource files, but also for suite files (e.g. `tests.robot`) and for suite
initialization files (`__init__.robot`). The primary use case was making it
possible for editors to show HTML documentation for keywords regardless
the file user is editing, but naturally such HTML documentation can be useful
also otherwise. (`#4493`_)

Libdoc has also got new `--theme` option that can be used to enforce dark
or light theme. The theme used by the browser is used by default as earlier.
External tools can control the theme also programmatically when generating
documentation and by calling the `setTheme()` Javascript function. (`#4497`_)

Performance enhancements for executing user keywords
----------------------------------------------------

The overhead in executing user keywords has been reduced. The difference
can be seen especially if user keywords fail often, for example, when using
`Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` or a loop with `TRY/EXCEPT`. (`#4388`_)

Python 3.11 support
--------------------

Robot Framework 6.0 officially supports the forthcoming Python 3.11
release (`#4401`_). Incompatibilities were not too big, so also the earlier
versions work fairly well.

At the other end of the spectrum, Python 3.6 is deprecated and will not
anymore be supported by Robot Framework 7.0 (`#4295`_).


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

- Space is required after `Given/When/Then` prefixes used with BDD scenarios. (`#4379`_)

- Dictionary related keywords in `Collections` require dictionaries to inherit `Mapping`. (`#4413`_)

- `Dictionary Should Contain Item` from the Collections library does not anymore convert
  values to strings before comparison. (`#4408`_)

- Automatic `TypedDict` conversion can cause problems if a keyword expects to get any
  dictionary. Nowadays dictionaries that do not match the type spec cause failures
  and the keyword is not called at all. (`#4477`_)

- Generation time in XML and JSON spec files generated by Libdoc has been changed to
  `2022-05-27T19:07:15+00:00`. With XML specs the format used to be `2022-05-27T19:07:15Z`
  that is equivalent with the new format. JSON spec files did not include the timezone
  information at all and the format was `2022-05-27 19:07:15`. (`#4262`_)

- `BuiltIn.run_keyword()` nowadays resolves variables in the name of the keyword to
  execute when earlier they were resolved by Robot Framework before calling the keyword.
  This affects programmatic usage if the used name contains variables or backslashes.
  The change was done when enhancing how keywords with embedded arguments work with
  `BuiltIn.run_keyword()`. (`#1595`_)


Deprecated features
===================

`Force Tags` and `Default Tags` settings
----------------------------------------

As `discussed above`__, new `Test Tags` setting has been added to replace `Force Tags`
and there is a plan to remove `Default Tags` altogether. Both of these settings still
work but they are considered deprecated. There is no visible deprecation warning yet,
but such a warning will be emitted starting from Robot Framework 7.0 and eventually these
settings will be removed. (`#4368`_)

The plan is to add new `-tag` syntax that can be used with the `[Tags]` setting
to enable similar functionality that the `Default Tags` setting provides. Because
of that, using tags starting with a hyphen with the `[Tags]` setting is now deprecated.
If such literal values are needed, it is possible to use escaped format like `\-tag`.
(`#4380`_)

__ `Enhancements for setting keyword and test tags`_

Keywords in test case files having precedence over local keywords in resource files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keywords in test cases files currently always have the highest precedence. They
are used even when a keyword in a resource file uses a keyword that would exist also
in the same resource file. This will change so that local keywords always have
highest precedence and the current behavior is deprecated. (`#4366`_)

`WITH NAME` in favor of `AS` when giving alias to imported library
------------------------------------------------------------------

`WITH NAME` marker that is used when giving an alias to an imported library
will be renamed to `AS` (`#4371`_). The motivation is to be consistent with
Python that uses `as` for similar purpose. We also already use `AS` with
`TRY/EXCEPT` and reusing the same marker and internally used token simplifies
the syntax. Having less markers will also ease translations (but these markers
cannot yet be translated).

In Robot Framework 6.0 both `AS` and `WITH NAME` work when setting an alias
for a library. `WITH NAME` is considered deprecated, but there will not be
visible deprecation warnings until Robot Framework 7.0.

Singular section headers like `Test Case`
-----------------------------------------

Robot Framework has earlier accepted both plural (e.g. `Test Cases`) and singular
(e.g. `Test Case`) section headers. The singular variants are now deprecated
and their support will eventually be removed (`#4431`_). The is no visible
deprecation warning yet, but they will most likely be emitted starting from
Robot Framework 7.0.

Using variables with embedded arguments so that value does not match custom pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When keywords accepting embedded arguments are used so that arguments are
passed as variables, variable values are not checked against possible custom
regular expressions. Keywords being called with arguments they explicitly do not
accept is problematic and this behavior will be changed. Due to the backwards
compatibility it is now only deprecated, but validation will be more strict
in the future. (`#4462`_)

Custom patterns have often been used to avoid conflicts when using embedded arguments.
That need is nowadays smaller because Robot Framework 6.0 can typically resolve
conflicts automatically. (`#4454`_)

`robot.utils.TRUE_STRINGS` and `robot.utils.FALSE_STRINGS`
----------------------------------------------------------

These constants were earlier sometimes needed by libraries when converting
arguments passed to keywords to Boolean values. Nowadays automatic argument
conversion takes care of that and these constants do not have any real usage.
They can still be used and there is not even a deprecation warning yet,
but they will be loudly deprecated and eventually removed later. (`#4500`_)

These constants are internally used by `is_truthy` and `is_falsy` utility
functions that some of Robot Framework standard libraries still use.
Also these utils are likely to be deprecated in the future, and users are
advised to use the automatic argument conversion instead of them.

Python 3.6 support
------------------

Python 3.6 `reached end-of-life`__ in December 2021. It will be still supported
by all future Robot Framework 6.x releases, but not anymore by Robot Framework
7.0 (`#4295`_). Users are recommended to upgrade to newer versions already now.
