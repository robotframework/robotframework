How to contribute
=================

Creating issues: reporting bugs and requesting enhancements
-----------------------------------------

Bugs and enhancements are tracked in `Github's issue
tracker <https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues>`__.
You can try asking first in IRC (#robotframework on irc.freenode.net) or
in the `user
group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/robotframework-users>`__.
Make sure to look through the list of open issues first so that you
don't create a duplicate. When reporting a bug, provide as much
information about the bug as possible: a stack trace or error message,
an example test case or keyword, a log file, and so on. When requesting
an enhancement, describe your use case in as much detail as possible.

Choosing something to work on
-----------------------------

Look through the `issue
tracker <https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues>`__ to
find bugs and enhancements to work on. The issues vary significantly in
complexity and difficulty, so you can try to find something that matches
your skill level and knowledge.

Creating a pull request
-----------------------

Github has a `good article describing pull
requests <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`__.

Style guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with most Python projects, Robot Framework mostly follows
`PEP-8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__. When possible,
write code that's easy to understand without requiring comments. Any new
files you add should include the Apache License header.

Testing your changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two sets of tests within Robot Framework: ``atest`` and
``utest``. When submitting a pull request, you should always include
tests for your changes. These tests prove that your changes work, help
prevent bugs in the future, and help document what your changes do. Make
sure to run all of the tests before submitting a pull request to be sure
that your changes don't break anything. If you can, test in multiple
environments and interpreters (Windows, Linux, OS X, python, jython,
ironpython, etc).

Acceptance tests (atest)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a set of tests for Robot Framework written using Robot
Framework. See the `README <atest/README.rst>`__ for more details. If
possible, the tests for your pull request should be acceptance tests.

Unit tests (utest)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a set of tests for Robot Framework written using Python's
``unittest`` module. See the `README <utest/README.rst>`__ for more
details.

Continuous integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a new pull request comes in, the CI will ask if one of the admins
can verify the pull request. The admins are currently @jussimalinen and
@pekkaklarck. The commands are:

-  ``robotci: once`` (run once)
-  ``robotci: enable`` (run when ever this pull request changes)
-  ``robotci: whitelist user`` (enable CI for all pull requests coming
   from this user)

The commands can be anywhere on the comment. Adding the skip statement
(``[skip ci]``, with the square brackets) to the pull request body will
cause the job not to run.

AUTHORS.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~

Add yourself to ``AUTHORS.txt`` if you'd like credit for your changes.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your changes modify Robot Framework's behavior in any way, or if
you're contributing documentation, see the `documentation
README <doc/userguide/README.rst>`__. The libraries that come with Robot
Framework (``BuiltIn``, ``Collections``, etc.) have keyword docstrings
that serve as their documentation. Make sure to update these if
necessary. Functions and methods intended for internal use only
generally do not require docstrings as long as they are written clearly
enough that their purpose can be understood by reading their code.

Squashing and resolving conflicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your pull request has been accepted for merging by the project
owners, if you have a lot of commits, you should `squash your
commits <http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2014/02/19/squashing-github-pull-requests-into-a-single-commit>`__.
If your pull request has conflicts with master, rebase your changes with
master to allow for an easy merge.
