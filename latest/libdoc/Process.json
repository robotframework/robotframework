  "doc": "Robot Framework library for running processes.\n\nThis library utilizes Python's\n[http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html|subprocess]\nmodule and its\n[http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor|Popen]\nclass.\n\nThe library has following main usages:\n\n- Running processes in system and waiting for their completion using\n  `Run Process` keyword.\n- Starting processes on background using `Start Process`.\n- Waiting started process to complete using `Wait For Process` or\n  stopping them with `Terminate Process` or `Terminate All Processes`.\n\n== Table of contents ==\n\n- `Specifying command and arguments`\n- `Process configuration`\n- `Active process`\n- `Result object`\n- `Boolean arguments`\n- `Example`\n- `Keywords`\n\n= Specifying command and arguments =\n\nBoth `Run Process` and `Start Process` accept the command to execute and\nall arguments passed to the command as separate arguments. This makes usage\nconvenient and also allows these keywords to automatically escape possible\nspaces and other special characters in commands and arguments. Notice that\nif a command accepts options that themselves accept values, these options\nand their values must be given as separate arguments.\n\nWhen `running processes in shell`, it is also possible to give the whole\ncommand to execute as a single string. The command can then contain\nmultiple commands to be run together. When using this approach, the caller\nis responsible on escaping.\n\nExamples:\n| `Run Process` | ${tools}${/}prog.py | argument | second arg with spaces |\n| `Run Process` | java | -jar | ${jars}${/}example.jar | --option | value |\n| `Run Process` | prog.py \"one arg\" && tool.sh | shell=yes | cwd=${tools} |\n\nPossible non-string arguments are converted to strings automatically.\n\n= Process configuration =\n\n`Run Process` and `Start Process` keywords can be configured using\noptional ``**configuration`` keyword arguments. Configuration arguments\nmust be given after other arguments passed to these keywords and must\nuse syntax like ``name=value``. Available configuration arguments are\nlisted below and discussed further in sections afterwards.\n\n|  = Name =  |                  = Explanation =                      |\n| shell      | Specifies whether to run the command in shell or not. |\n| cwd        | Specifies the working directory.                      |\n| env        | Specifies environment variables given to the process. |\n| env:<name> | Overrides the named environment variable(s) only.     |\n| stdout     | Path of a file where to write standard output.        |\n| stderr     | Path of a file where to write standard error.         |\n| stdin      | Configure process standard input. New in RF 4.1.2.    |\n| output_encoding | Encoding to use when reading command outputs.    |\n| alias      | Alias given to the process.                           |\n\nNote that because ``**configuration`` is passed using ``name=value`` syntax,\npossible equal signs in other arguments passed to `Run Process` and\n`Start Process` must be escaped with a backslash like ``name\\=value``.\nSee `Run Process` for an example.\n\n== Running processes in shell ==\n\nThe ``shell`` argument specifies whether to run the process in a shell or\nnot. By default shell is not used, which means that shell specific commands,\nlike ``copy`` and ``dir`` on Windows, are not available. You can, however,\nrun shell scripts and batch files without using a shell.\n\nGiving the ``shell`` argument any non-false value, such as ``shell=True``,\nchanges the program to be executed in a shell. It allows using the shell\ncapabilities, but can also make the process invocation operating system\ndependent. Having a shell between the actually started process and this\nlibrary can also interfere communication with the process such as stopping\nit and reading its outputs. Because of these problems, it is recommended\nto use the shell only when absolutely necessary.\n\nWhen using a shell it is possible to give the whole command to execute\nas a single string. See `Specifying command and arguments` section for\nexamples and more details in general.\n\n== Current working directory ==\n\nBy default, the child process will be executed in the same directory\nas the parent process, the process running Robot Framework, is executed. This\ncan be changed by giving an alternative location using the ``cwd`` argument.\nForward slashes in the given path are automatically converted to\nbackslashes on Windows.\n\n`Standard output and error streams`, when redirected to files,\nare also relative to the current working directory possibly set using\nthe ``cwd`` argument.\n\nExample:\n| `Run Process` | prog.exe | cwd=${ROOT}/directory | stdout=stdout.txt |\n\n== Environment variables ==\n\nBy default the child process will get a copy of the parent process's\nenvironment variables. The ``env`` argument can be used to give the\nchild a custom environment as a Python dictionary. If there is a need\nto specify only certain environment variable, it is possible to use the\n``env:<name>=<value>`` format to set or override only that named variables.\nIt is also possible to use these two approaches together.\n\nExamples:\n| `Run Process` | program | env=${environ} |\n| `Run Process` | program | env:http_proxy=10.144.1.10:8080 | env:PATH=%{PATH}${:}${PROGDIR} |\n| `Run Process` | program | env=${environ} | env:EXTRA=value |\n\n== Standard output and error streams ==\n\nBy default processes are run so that their standard output and standard\nerror streams are kept in the memory. This works fine normally,\nbut if there is a lot of output, the output buffers may get full and\nthe program can hang.\n\nTo avoid the above mentioned problems, it is possible to use ``stdout``\nand ``stderr`` arguments to specify files on the file system where to\nredirect the outputs. This can also be useful if other processes or\nother keywords need to read or manipulate the outputs somehow.\n\nGiven ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` paths are relative to the `current working\ndirectory`. Forward slashes in the given paths are automatically converted\nto backslashes on Windows.\n\nAs a special feature, it is possible to redirect the standard error to\nthe standard output by using ``stderr=STDOUT``.\n\nRegardless are outputs redirected to files or not, they are accessible\nthrough the `result object` returned when the process ends. Commands are\nexpected to write outputs using the console encoding, but `output encoding`\ncan be configured using the ``output_encoding`` argument if needed.\n\nIf you are not interested in outputs at all, you can explicitly ignore them\nby using a special value ``DEVNULL`` both with ``stdout`` and ``stderr``. For\nexample, ``stdout=DEVNULL`` is the same as redirecting output on console\nwith ``> /dev/null`` on UNIX-like operating systems or ``> NUL`` on Windows.\nThis way the process will not hang even if there would be a lot of output,\nbut naturally output is not available after execution either.\n\nSupport for the special value ``DEVNULL`` is new in Robot Framework 3.2.\n\nExamples:\n| ${result} = | `Run Process` | program | stdout=${TEMPDIR}/stdout.txt | stderr=${TEMPDIR}/stderr.txt |\n| `Log Many`  | stdout: ${result.stdout} | stderr: ${result.stderr} |\n| ${result} = | `Run Process` | program | stderr=STDOUT |\n| `Log`       | all output: ${result.stdout} |\n| ${result} = | `Run Process` | program | stdout=DEVNULL | stderr=DEVNULL |\n\nNote that the created output files are not automatically removed after\nthe test run. The user is responsible to remove them if needed.\n\n== Standard input stream ==\n\nThe ``stdin`` argument makes it possible to pass information to the standard\ninput stream of the started process. How its value is interpreted is\nexplained in the table below.\n\n| = Value =        | = Explanation = |\n| String ``PIPE``  | Make stdin a pipe that can be written to. This is the default. |\n| String ``NONE``  | Inherit stdin from the parent process. This value is case-insensitive. |\n| Path to a file   | Open the specified file and use it as the stdin. |\n| Any other string | Create a temporary file with the text as its content and use it as the stdin. |\n| Any non-string value | Used as-is. Could be a file descriptor, stdout of another process, etc. |\n\nValues ``PIPE`` and ``NONE`` are internally mapped directly to\n``subprocess.PIPE`` and ``None``, respectively, when calling\n[https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen|subprocess.Popen].\nThe default behavior may change from ``PIPE`` to ``NONE`` in future\nreleases. If you depend on the ``PIPE`` behavior, it is a good idea to use\nit explicitly.\n\nExamples:\n| `Run Process` | command | stdin=NONE |\n| `Run Process` | command | stdin=${CURDIR}/stdin.txt |\n| `Run Process` | command | stdin=Stdin as text. |\n\nThe support to configure ``stdin`` is new in Robot Framework 4.1.2.\n\n== Output encoding ==\n\nExecuted commands are, by default, expected to write outputs to the\n`standard output and error streams` using the encoding used by the\nsystem console. If the command uses some other encoding, that can be\nconfigured using the ``output_encoding`` argument. This is especially\nuseful on Windows where the console uses a different encoding than rest\nof the system, and many commands use the general system encoding instead\nof the console encoding.\n\nThe value used with the ``output_encoding`` argument must be a valid\nencoding and must match the encoding actually used by the command. As a\nconvenience, it is possible to use strings ``CONSOLE`` and ``SYSTEM``\nto specify that the console or system encoding is used, respectively.\nIf produced outputs use different encoding then configured, values got\nthrough the `result object` will be invalid.\n\nExamples:\n| `Start Process` | program | output_encoding=UTF-8 |\n| `Run Process`   | program | stdout=${path} | output_encoding=SYSTEM |\n\n== Alias ==\n\nA custom name given to the process that can be used when selecting the\n`active process`.\n\nExamples:\n| `Start Process` | program | alias=example |\n| `Run Process`   | python  | -c | print('hello') | alias=hello |\n\n= Active process =\n\nThe library keeps record which of the started processes is currently active.\nBy default it is the latest process started with `Start Process`,\nbut `Switch Process` can be used to activate a different process. Using\n`Run Process` does not affect the active process.\n\nThe keywords that operate on started processes will use the active process\nby default, but it is possible to explicitly select a different process\nusing the ``handle`` argument. The handle can be an ``alias`` explicitly\ngiven to `Start Process` or the process object returned by it.\n\n= Result object =\n\n`Run Process`, `Wait For Process` and `Terminate Process` keywords return a\nresult object that contains information about the process execution as its\nattributes. The same result object, or some of its attributes, can also\nbe get using `Get Process Result` keyword. Attributes available in the\nobject are documented in the table below.\n\n| = Attribute = |             = Explanation =               |\n| rc            | Return code of the process as an integer. |\n| stdout        | Contents of the standard output stream.   |\n| stderr        | Contents of the standard error stream.    |\n| stdout_path   | Path where stdout was redirected or ``None`` if not redirected. |\n| stderr_path   | Path where stderr was redirected or ``None`` if not redirected. |\n\nExample:\n| ${result} =            | `Run Process`         | program               |\n| `Should Be Equal As Integers` | ${result.rc}   | 0                     |\n| `Should Match`         | ${result.stdout}      | Some t?xt*            |\n| `Should Be Empty`      | ${result.stderr}      |                       |\n| ${stdout} =            | `Get File`            | ${result.stdout_path} |\n| `Should Be Equal`      | ${stdout}             | ${result.stdout}      |\n| `File Should Be Empty` | ${result.stderr_path} |                       |\n\n= Boolean arguments =\n\nSome keywords accept arguments that are handled as Boolean values true or\nfalse. If such an argument is given as a string, it is considered false if\nit is an empty string or equal to ``FALSE``, ``NONE``, ``NO``, ``OFF`` or\n``0``, case-insensitively. Other strings are considered true regardless\ntheir value, and other argument types are tested using the same\n[http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#truth|rules as in Python].\n\nTrue examples:\n| `Terminate Process` | kill=True     | # Strings are generally true.    |\n| `Terminate Process` | kill=yes      | # Same as the above.             |\n| `Terminate Process` | kill=${TRUE}  | # Python ``True`` is true.       |\n| `Terminate Process` | kill=${42}    | # Numbers other than 0 are true. |\n\nFalse examples:\n| `Terminate Process` | kill=False    | # String ``false`` is false.   |\n| `Terminate Process` | kill=no       | # Also string ``no`` is false. |\n| `Terminate Process` | kill=${EMPTY} | # Empty string is false.       |\n| `Terminate Process` | kill=${FALSE} | # Python ``False`` is false.   |\n\nConsidering ``OFF`` and ``0`` false is new in Robot Framework 3.1.\n\n= Example =\n\n| ***** Settings *****\n| Library           Process\n| Suite Teardown    `Terminate All Processes`    kill=True\n|\n| ***** Test Cases *****\n| Example\n|     `Start Process`    program    arg1    arg2    alias=First\n|     ${handle} =    `Start Process`    command.sh arg | command2.sh    shell=True    cwd=/path\n|     ${result} =    `Run Process`    ${CURDIR}/script.py\n|     `Should Not Contain`    ${result.stdout}    FAIL\n|     `Terminate Process`    ${handle}\n|     ${result} =    `Wait For Process`    First\n|     `Should Be Equal As Integers`    ${result.rc}    0",
