  "doc": "An always available standard library with often needed keywords.\n\n``BuiltIn`` is Robot Framework's standard library that provides a set\nof generic keywords needed often. It is imported automatically and\nthus always available. The provided keywords can be used, for example,\nfor verifications (e.g. `Should Be Equal`, `Should Contain`),\nconversions (e.g. `Convert To Integer`) and for various other purposes\n(e.g. `Log`, `Sleep`, `Run Keyword If`, `Set Global Variable`).\n\n== Table of contents ==\n\n- `HTML error messages`\n- `Evaluating expressions`\n- `Using variables with keywords creating or accessing variables`\n- `Boolean arguments`\n- `Pattern matching`\n- `Multiline string comparison`\n- `String representations`\n- `Keywords`\n\n= HTML error messages =\n\nMany of the keywords accept an optional error message to use if the keyword\nfails, and it is possible to use HTML in these messages by prefixing them\nwith ``*HTML*``. See `Fail` keyword for a usage example. Notice that using\nHTML in messages is not limited to BuiltIn library but works with any\nerror message.\n\n= Evaluating expressions =\n\nMany keywords, such as `Evaluate`, `Run Keyword If` and `Should Be True`,\naccept an expression that is evaluated in Python.\n\n== Evaluation namespace ==\n\nExpressions are evaluated using Python's\n[http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#eval|eval] function so\nthat all Python built-ins like ``len()`` and ``int()`` are available.\nIn addition to that, all unrecognized variables are considered to be\nmodules that are automatically imported. It is possible to use all\navailable Python modules, including the standard modules and the installed\nthird party modules.\n\nExamples:\n| `Should Be True`    len('${result}') > 3\n| `Run Keyword If`    os.sep == '/'    Non-Windows Keyword\n| ${version} =    `Evaluate`    robot.__version__\n\n`Evaluate` also allows configuring the execution namespace with a custom\nnamespace and with custom modules to be imported. The latter functionality\nis useful in special cases where the automatic module import does not work\nsuch as when using nested modules like ``rootmod.submod`` or list\ncomprehensions. See the documentation of the `Evaluate` keyword for mode\ndetails.\n\n== Variables in expressions ==\n\nWhen a variable is used in the expressing using the normal ``${variable}``\nsyntax, its value is replaced before the expression is evaluated. This\nmeans that the value used in the expression will be the string\nrepresentation of the variable value, not the variable value itself.\nThis is not a problem with numbers and other objects that have a string\nrepresentation that can be evaluated directly, but with other objects\nthe behavior depends on the string representation. Most importantly,\nstrings must always be quoted, and if they can contain newlines, they must\nbe triple quoted.\n\nExamples:\n| `Should Be True`    ${rc} < 10                   Return code greater than 10\n| `Run Keyword If`    '${status}' == 'PASS'        Log    Passed\n| `Run Keyword If`    'FAIL' in '''${output}'''    Log    Output contains FAIL\n\nActual variables values are also available in the evaluation namespace.\nThey can be accessed using special variable syntax without the curly\nbraces like ``$variable``. These variables should never be quoted.\n\nExamples:\n| `Should Be True`    $rc < 10             Return code greater than 10\n| `Run Keyword If`    $status == 'PASS'    `Log`    Passed\n| `Run Keyword If`    'FAIL' in $output    `Log`    Output contains FAIL\n| `Should Be True`    len($result) > 1 and $result[1] == 'OK'\n| `Should Be True`    $result is not None\n\nUsing the ``$variable`` syntax slows down expression evaluation a little.\nThis should not typically matter, but should be taken into account if\ncomplex expressions are evaluated often and there are strict time\nconstrains.\n\nNotice that instead of creating complicated expressions, it is often better\nto move the logic into a library. That eases maintenance and can also\nenhance execution speed.\n\n= Using variables with keywords creating or accessing variables =\n\nThis library has special keywords `Set Global Variable`, `Set Suite Variable`,\n`Set Test Variable` and `Set Local Variable` for creating variables in\ndifferent scopes. These keywords take the variable name and its value as\narguments. The name can be given using the normal ``${variable}`` syntax or\nin escaped format either like ``$variable`` or ``\\${variable}``. For example,\nthese are typically equivalent and create new suite level variable\n``${name}`` with value ``value``:\n\n| Set Suite Variable    ${name}     value\n| Set Suite Variable    $name       value\n| Set Suite Variable    \\${name}    value\n\nA problem with using the normal ``${variable}`` syntax is that these\nkeywords cannot easily know is the idea to create a variable with exactly\nthat name or does that variable actually contain the name of the variable\nto create. If the variable does not initially exist, it will always be\ncreated. If it exists and its value is a variable name either in the normal\nor in the escaped syntax, variable with _that_ name is created instead.\nFor example, if ``${name}`` variable would exist and contain value\n``$example``, these examples would create different variables:\n\n| Set Suite Variable    ${name}     value    # Creates ${example}.\n| Set Suite Variable    $name       value    # Creates ${name}.\n| Set Suite Variable    \\${name}    value    # Creates ${name}.\n\nBecause the behavior when using the normal ``${variable}`` syntax depends\non the possible existing value of the variable, it is *highly recommended\nto use the escaped ``$variable`` or ``\\${variable}`` format instead*.\n\nThis same problem occurs also with special keywords for accessing variables\n`Get Variable Value`, `Variable Should Exist` and `Variable Should Not Exist`.\n\n*NOTE:* It is recommended to use the ``VAR`` syntax introduced in Robot\nFramework 7.0 for creating variables in different scopes instead of the\n`Set Global/Suite/Test/Local Variable` keywords. It makes creating variables\nuniform and avoids all the problems discussed above.\n\n= Boolean arguments =\n\nSome keywords accept arguments that are handled as Boolean values true or\nfalse. If such an argument is given as a string, it is considered false if\nit is an empty string or equal to ``FALSE``, ``NONE``, ``NO``, ``OFF`` or\n``0``, case-insensitively. Keywords verifying something that allow dropping\nactual and expected values from the possible error message also consider\nstring ``no values`` to be false. Other strings are considered true unless\nthe keyword documentation explicitly states otherwise, and other argument\ntypes are tested using the same\n[http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#truth|rules as in Python].\n\nTrue examples:\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${x}    ${y}    Custom error    values=True         # Strings are generally true.\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${x}    ${y}    Custom error    values=yes          # Same as the above.\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${x}    ${y}    Custom error    values=${TRUE}      # Python ``True`` is true.\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${x}    ${y}    Custom error    values=${42}        # Numbers other than 0 are true.\n\nFalse examples:\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${x}    ${y}    Custom error    values=False        # String ``false`` is false.\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${x}    ${y}    Custom error    values=no           # Also string ``no`` is false.\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${x}    ${y}    Custom error    values=${EMPTY}     # Empty string is false.\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${x}    ${y}    Custom error    values=${FALSE}     # Python ``False`` is false.\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${x}    ${y}    Custom error    values=no values    # ``no values`` works with ``values`` argument\n\n= Pattern matching =\n\nMany keywords accept arguments as either glob or regular expression patterns.\n\n== Glob patterns ==\n\nSome keywords, for example `Should Match`, support so called\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)|glob patterns] where:\n\n| ``*``        | matches any string, even an empty string                |\n| ``?``        | matches any single character                            |\n| ``[chars]``  | matches one character in the bracket                    |\n| ``[!chars]`` | matches one character not in the bracket                |\n| ``[a-z]``    | matches one character from the range in the bracket     |\n| ``[!a-z]``   | matches one character not from the range in the bracket |\n\nUnlike with glob patterns normally, path separator characters ``/`` and\n``\\`` and the newline character ``\\n`` are matches by the above\nwildcards.\n\n== Regular expressions ==\n\nSome keywords, for example `Should Match Regexp`, support\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression|regular expressions]\nthat are more powerful but also more complicated that glob patterns.\nThe regular expression support is implemented using Python's\n[http://docs.python.org/library/re.html|re module] and its documentation\nshould be consulted for more information about the syntax.\n\nBecause the backslash character (``\\``) is an escape character in\nRobot Framework test data, possible backslash characters in regular\nexpressions need to be escaped with another backslash like ``\\\\d\\\\w+``.\nStrings that may contain special characters but should be handled\nas literal strings, can be escaped with the `Regexp Escape` keyword.\n\n= Multiline string comparison =\n\n`Should Be Equal` and `Should Be Equal As Strings` report the failures using\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_utility#Unified_format|unified diff\nformat] if both strings have more than two lines.\n\nExample:\n| ${first} =     `Catenate`    SEPARATOR=\\n    Not in second    Same    Differs    Same\n| ${second} =    `Catenate`    SEPARATOR=\\n    Same    Differs2    Same    Not in first\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${first}    ${second}\n\nResults in the following error message:\n\n| Multiline strings are different:\n| --- first\n| +++ second\n| @@ -1,4 +1,4 @@\n| -Not in second\n|  Same\n| -Differs\n| +Differs2\n|  Same\n| +Not in first\n\n= String representations =\n\nSeveral keywords log values explicitly (e.g. `Log`) or implicitly (e.g.\n`Should Be Equal` when there are failures). By default, keywords log values\nusing human-readable string representation, which means that strings\nlike ``Hello`` and numbers like ``42`` are logged as-is. Most of the time\nthis is the desired behavior, but there are some problems as well:\n\n- It is not possible to see difference between different objects that\n  have the same string representation like string ``42`` and integer ``42``.\n  `Should Be Equal` and some other keywords add the type information to\n  the error message in these cases, though.\n\n- Non-printable characters such as the null byte are not visible.\n\n- Trailing whitespace is not visible.\n\n- Different newlines (``\\r\\n`` on Windows, ``\\n`` elsewhere) cannot\n  be separated from each others.\n\n- There are several Unicode characters that are different but look the\n  same. One example is the Latin ``a`` (``\\u0061``) and the Cyrillic\n  ``\u0430`` (``\\u0430``). Error messages like ``a != \u0430`` are not very helpful.\n\n- Some Unicode characters can be represented using\n  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence|different forms].\n  For example, ``\u00e4`` can be represented either as a single code point\n  ``\\u00e4`` or using two combined code points ``\\u0061`` and ``\\u0308``.\n  Such forms are considered canonically equivalent, but strings\n  containing them are not considered equal when compared in Python. Error\n  messages like ``\u00e4 != \u00e4`` are not that helpful either.\n\n- Containers such as lists and dictionaries are formatted into a single\n  line making it hard to see individual items they contain.\n\nTo overcome the above problems, some keywords such as `Log` and\n`Should Be Equal` have an optional ``formatter`` argument that can be\nused to configure the string representation. The supported values are\n``str`` (default), ``repr``, and ``ascii`` that work similarly as\n[https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html|Python built-in functions]\nwith same names. More detailed semantics are explained below.\n\n== str ==\n\nUse the human-readable string representation. Equivalent to using ``str()``\nin Python. This is the default.\n\n== repr ==\n\nUse the machine-readable string representation. Similar to using ``repr()``\nin Python, which means that strings like ``Hello`` are logged like\n``'Hello'``, newlines and non-printable characters are escaped like ``\\n``\nand ``\\x00``, and so on. Non-ASCII characters are shown as-is like ``\u00e4``.\n\nIn this mode bigger lists, dictionaries and other containers are\npretty-printed so that there is one item per row.\n\n== ascii ==\n\nSame as using ``ascii()`` in Python. Similar to using ``repr`` explained above\nbut with the following differences:\n\n- Non-ASCII characters are escaped like ``\\xe4`` instead of\n  showing them as-is like ``\u00e4``. This makes it easier to see differences\n  between Unicode characters that look the same but are not equal.\n- Containers are not pretty-printed.",

Variables are also\navailable in the evaluation namespace and can be accessed using special\n``$variable`` syntax as explained in the `Evaluating expressions` section.\n\nExample:\n| `Run Keyword If` | $result is None or $result == 'FAIL' | Keyword |\n\nThis keyword supports also optional ELSE and ELSE IF branches. Both\nof them are defined in ``*args`` and must use exactly format ``ELSE``\nor ``ELSE IF``, respectively. ELSE branches must contain first the\nname of the keyword to execute and then its possible arguments. ELSE\nIF branches must first contain a condition, like the first argument\nto this keyword, and then the keyword to execute and its possible\narguments. It is possible to have ELSE branch after ELSE IF and to\nhave multiple ELSE IF branches. Nested `Run Keyword If` usage is not\nsupported when using ELSE and/or ELSE IF branches.\n\nGiven previous example, if/else construct can also be created like this:\n| `Run Keyword If` | '${status}' == 'PASS' | Some Action | arg | ELSE | Another Action |\n\nThe return value of this keyword is the return value of the actually\nexecuted keyword or Python ``None`` if no keyword was executed (i.e.\nif ``condition`` was false). Hence, it is recommended to use ELSE\nand/or ELSE IF branches to conditionally assign return values from\nkeyword to variables (see `Set Variable If` you need to set fixed\nvalues conditionally). This is illustrated by the example below:\n\n| ${var1} =   | `Run Keyword If` | ${rc} == 0     | Some keyword returning a value |\n| ...         | ELSE IF          | 0 < ${rc} < 42 | Another keyword |\n| ...         | ELSE IF          | ${rc} < 0      | Another keyword with args | ${rc} | arg2 |\n| ...         | ELSE             | Final keyword to handle abnormal cases | ${rc} |\n| ${var2} =   | `Run Keyword If` | ${condition}  | Some keyword |\n\nIn this example, ${var2} will be set to ``None`` if ${condition} is\nfalse.\n\nNotice that ``ELSE`` and ``ELSE IF`` control words must be used\nexplicitly and thus cannot come from variables. If you need to use\nliteral ``ELSE`` and ``ELSE IF`` strings as arguments, you can escape\nthem with a backslash like ``\\ELSE`` and ``\\ELSE IF``.",

How long to retry running the keyword is\ndefined using ``retry`` argument either as timeout or count.\n``retry_interval`` is the time to wait between execution attempts.\n\nIf ``retry`` is given as timeout, it must be in Robot Framework's\ntime format (e.g. ``1 minute``, ``2 min 3 s``, ``4.5``) that is\nexplained in an appendix of Robot Framework User Guide. If it is\ngiven as count, it must have ``times`` or ``x`` postfix (e.g.\n``5 times``, ``10 x``). ``retry_interval`` must always be given in\nRobot Framework's time format.\n\nBy default, ``retry_interval`` is the time to wait _after_ a keyword has\nfailed. For example, if the first run takes 2 seconds and the retry\ninterval is 3 seconds, the second run starts 5 seconds after the first\nrun started. If ``retry_interval`` start with prefix ``strict:``, the\nexecution time of the previous keyword is subtracted from the retry time.\nWith the earlier example the second run would thus start 3 seconds after\nthe first run started. A warning is logged if keyword execution time is\nlonger than a strict interval.\n\nIf the keyword does not succeed regardless of retries, this keyword\nfails. If the executed keyword passes, its return value is returned.\n\nExamples:\n| Wait Until Keyword Succeeds | 2 min | 5 sec | My keyword | argument |\n| ${result} = | Wait Until Keyword Succeeds | 3x | 200ms | My keyword |\n| ${result} = | Wait Until Keyword Succeeds | 3x | strict: 200ms | My keyword |\n\nAll normal failures are caught by this keyword. Errors caused by\ninvalid syntax, test or keyword timeouts, or fatal exceptions (caused\ne.g. by `Fatal Error`) are not caught.\n\nRunning the same keyword multiple times inside this keyword can create\nlots of output and considerably increase the size of the generated\noutput files. It is possible to remove unnecessary keywords from\nthe outputs using the ``--remove-keywords WUKS`` command line option.\n\nSupport for \"strict\" retry interval is new in Robot Framework 4.1.",
