  "doc": "An always available standard library with often needed keywords.\n\n``BuiltIn`` is Robot Framework's standard library that provides a set\nof generic keywords needed often. It is imported automatically and\nthus always available. The provided keywords can be used, for example,\nfor verifications (e.g. `Should Be Equal`, `Should Contain`),\nconversions (e.g. `Convert To Integer`) and for various other purposes\n(e.g. `Log`, `Sleep`, `Run Keyword If`, `Set Global Variable`).\n\n== Table of contents ==\n\n- `Controlling failure messages`\n- `String and bytes normalization`\n- `String representations`\n- `Evaluating expressions`\n- `Using variables with keywords creating or accessing variables`\n- `Pattern matching`\n- `Multiline string comparison`\n- `Keywords`\n\n= Controlling failure messages =\n\n== Overriding default error message ==\n\nVarious validation keywords accept ``msg`` and ``values`` arguments that\ncan be used to override keyword specific default failure messages.\n\n- If ``msg`` is given and ``values`` gets a true value (default),\n  the failure message is ``<msg>: <default-message>``.\n- If ``msg`` is given and ``values`` gets a false value, the message\n  is simply ``<msg>``.\n\nExamples:\n| Should Be Equal    x    y                               # Fails with 'x != y'.\n| Should Be Equal    x    y    Message                    # Fails with 'Message: x != y'.\n| Should Be Equal    x    y    Message    values=False    # Fails with 'Message'.\n\n== HTML messages ==\n\nIt is possible to use HTML formatting in failure messages by prefixing\nmessages with ``*HTML*``. Notice that this is not limited to the BuiltIn\nlibrary, but works with any error message.\n\nExample:\n| Fail   \u00a0*HTML*\u00a0<b>Message</b>    # Fails with '*Message*'.\n\n= String and bytes normalization =\n\nVarious validation keywords accept ``ignore_case``, ``strip_spaces`` and\n``collapse_spaces`` arguments that make it possible to normalize strings\nand bytes before comparison. They are all ``False`` by default, which means\nthat no normalization is done, but they can be individually enabled.\n\n- If ``ignore_case`` is given a true value, comparison is case-insensitive.\n-  If ``strip_spaces`` is given a value ``LEADING`` or ``TRAILING``\n   (case-insensitive), leading or trailing spaces, respectively, are removed\n   before comparison. This includes all white space characters such as\n   newlines and tabs.\n- If ``strip_spaces`` is given any other true value, both leading and trailing\n  white space is removed.\n- If ``collapse_spaces`` is given a true value, white space characters are\n  normalized to ASCII spaces and consecutive spaces are collapsed into\n  a single space.\n\nIf validated items are collections like lists or dictionaries, string and bytes\nnormalization is done recursively.\n\nSupport bytes normalization and recursive normalization with collectins\nare new in Robot Framework 7.4.\n\n= String representations =\n\nSeveral keywords log values explicitly (e.g. `Log`) or implicitly (e.g.\n`Should Be Equal` when there are failures). By default, keywords log values\nusing human-readable string representation, which means that strings\nlike ``Hello`` and numbers like ``42`` are logged as-is. Most of the time\nthis is the desired behavior, but there are some problems as well:\n\n- It is not possible to see difference between different objects that\n  have the same string representation like string ``42`` and integer ``42``.\n  `Should Be Equal` and some other keywords add the type information to\n  the error message in these cases, though.\n\n- Non-printable characters such as the null byte are not visible.\n\n- Trailing whitespace is not visible.\n\n- Different newlines (``\\r\\n`` on Windows, ``\\n`` elsewhere) cannot\n  be separated from each others.\n\n- There are several Unicode characters that are different but look the\n  same. One example is the Latin ``a`` (``\\u0061``) and the Cyrillic\n  ``\u0430`` (``\\u0430``). Error messages like ``a != \u0430`` are not very helpful.\n\n- Some Unicode characters can be represented using\n  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence|different forms].\n  For example, ``\u00e4`` can be represented either as a single code point\n  ``\\u00e4`` or using two combined code points ``\\u0061`` and ``\\u0308``.\n  Such forms are considered canonically equivalent, but strings\n  containing them are not considered equal when compared in Python. Error\n  messages like ``\u00e4 != \u00e4`` are not that helpful either.\n\n- Containers such as lists and dictionaries are formatted into a single\n  line making it hard to see individual items they contain.\n\nTo overcome the above problems, some keywords such as `Log` and\n`Should Be Equal` have an optional ``formatter`` argument that can be\nused to configure the string representation. The supported values are\n``str`` (default), ``repr``, and ``ascii`` that work similarly as\n[https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html|Python built-in functions]\nwith same names. More detailed semantics are explained below.\n\n== str ==\n\nUse the human-readable string representation. Equivalent to using ``str()``\nin Python. This is the default.\n\n== repr ==\n\nUse the machine-readable string representation. Similar to using ``repr()``\nin Python, which means that strings like ``Hello`` are logged like\n``'Hello'``, newlines and non-printable characters are escaped like ``\\n``\nand ``\\x00``, and so on. Non-ASCII characters are shown as-is like ``\u00e4``.\n\nIn this mode bigger lists, dictionaries and other collections are\npretty-printed so that there is one item per row.\n\n== ascii ==\n\nSame as using ``ascii()`` in Python. Similar to using ``repr`` explained above\nbut with the following differences:\n\n- Non-ASCII characters are escaped like ``\\xe4`` instead of\n  showing them as-is like ``\u00e4``. This makes it easier to see differences\n  between Unicode characters that are not equal but look the same.\n- Collections are not pretty-printed.\n\n= Evaluating expressions =\n\nMany keywords, such as `Evaluate`, `Run Keyword If` and `Should Be True`,\naccept an expression that is evaluated in Python.\n\n== Evaluation namespace ==\n\nExpressions are evaluated using Python's\n[http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#eval|eval] function so\nthat all Python built-ins like ``len()`` and ``int()`` are available.\nIn addition to that, all unrecognized variables are considered to be\nmodules that are automatically imported. It is possible to use all\navailable Python modules, including the standard modules and the installed\nthird party modules.\n\nExamples:\n| `Should Be True`    len('${result}') > 3\n| `Run Keyword If`    os.sep == '/'    Non-Windows Keyword\n| ${version} =      `Evaluate`    robot.__version__\n\n`Evaluate` also allows configuring the execution namespace with a custom\nnamespace and with custom modules to be imported. The latter functionality\nis useful in special cases where the automatic module import does not work\nsuch as when using nested modules like ``rootmod.submod`` or list\ncomprehensions. See the documentation of the `Evaluate` keyword for mode\ndetails.\n\n== Variables in expressions ==\n\nWhen a variable is used in the expressing using the normal ``${variable}``\nsyntax, its value is replaced before the expression is evaluated. This\nmeans that the value used in the expression will be the string\nrepresentation of the variable value, not the variable value itself.\nThis is not a problem with numbers and other objects that have a string\nrepresentation that can be evaluated directly, but with other objects\nthe behavior depends on the string representation. Most importantly,\nstrings must always be quoted, and if they can contain newlines, they must\nbe triple quoted.\n\nExamples:\n| `Should Be True`    ${rc} < 10                   Return code greater than 10\n| `Run Keyword If`    '${status}' == 'PASS'        `Log`    Passed\n| `Run Keyword If`    'FAIL' in '''${output}'''    `Log`    Output contains FAIL\n\nActual variables values are also available in the evaluation namespace.\nThey can be accessed using special variable syntax without the curly\nbraces like ``$variable``. These variables should never be quoted.\n\nExamples:\n| `Should Be True`    $rc < 10             Return code greater than 10\n| `Run Keyword If`    $status == 'PASS'    `Log`    Passed\n| `Run Keyword If`    'FAIL' in $output    `Log`    Output contains FAIL\n| `Should Be True`    len($result) > 1 and $result[1] == 'OK'\n| `Should Be True`    $result is not None\n\nUsing the ``$variable`` syntax slows down expression evaluation a little.\nThis should not typically matter, but should be taken into account if\ncomplex expressions are evaluated often and there are strict time\nconstrains.\n\nNotice that instead of creating complicated expressions, it is often better\nto move the logic into a library. That eases maintenance and can also\nenhance execution speed.\n\n= Using variables with keywords creating or accessing variables =\n\nThis library has special keywords `Set Global Variable`, `Set Suite Variable`,\n`Set Test Variable` and `Set Local Variable` for creating variables in\ndifferent scopes. These keywords take the variable name and its value as\narguments. The name can be given using the normal ``${variable}`` syntax or\nin escaped format either like ``$variable`` or ``\\${variable}``. For example,\nthese are typically equivalent and create new suite level variable\n``${name}`` with value ``value``:\n\n| Set Suite Variable    ${name}     value\n| Set Suite Variable    $name       value\n| Set Suite Variable    \\${name}    value\n\nA problem with using the normal ``${variable}`` syntax is that these\nkeywords cannot easily know is the idea to create a variable with exactly\nthat name or does that variable actually contain the name of the variable\nto create. If the variable does not initially exist, it will always be\ncreated. If it exists and its value is a variable name either in the normal\nor in the escaped syntax, variable with _that_ name is created instead.\nFor example, if ``${name}`` variable would exist and contain value\n``$example``, these examples would create different variables:\n\n| Set Suite Variable    ${name}     value    # Creates ${example}.\n| Set Suite Variable    $name       value    # Creates ${name}.\n| Set Suite Variable    \\${name}    value    # Creates ${name}.\n\nBecause the behavior when using the normal ``${variable}`` syntax depends\non the possible existing value of the variable, it is *highly recommended\nto use the escaped ``$variable`` or ``\\${variable}`` format instead*.\n\nThis same problem occurs also with special keywords for accessing variables\n`Get Variable Value`, `Variable Should Exist` and `Variable Should Not Exist`.\n\n*NOTE:* It is recommended to use the ``VAR`` syntax introduced in Robot\nFramework 7.0 for creating variables in different scopes instead of the\n`Set Global/Suite/Test/Local Variable` keywords. It makes creating variables\nuniform and avoids all the problems discussed above.\n\n= Pattern matching =\n\nMany keywords accept arguments as either glob or regular expression patterns.\n\n== Glob patterns ==\n\nSome keywords, for example `Should Match`, support so called\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)|glob patterns] where:\n\n| ``*``        | matches any string, even an empty string                |\n| ``?``        | matches any single character                            |\n| ``[chars]``  | matches one character in the bracket                    |\n| ``[!chars]`` | matches one character not in the bracket                |\n| ``[a-z]``    | matches one character from the range in the bracket     |\n| ``[!a-z]``   | matches one character not from the range in the bracket |\n\nUnlike with glob patterns normally, path separator characters ``/`` and\n``\\`` and the newline character ``\\n`` are matches by the above\nwildcards.\n\n== Regular expressions ==\n\nSome keywords, for example `Should Match Regexp`, support\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression|regular expressions]\nthat are more powerful but also more complicated that glob patterns.\nThe regular expression support is implemented using Python's\n[http://docs.python.org/library/re.html|re module] and its documentation\nshould be consulted for more information about the syntax.\n\nBecause the backslash character (``\\``) is an escape character in\nRobot Framework test data, possible backslash characters in regular\nexpressions need to be escaped with another backslash like ``\\\\d\\\\w+``.\nStrings that may contain special characters but should be handled\nas literal strings, can be escaped with the `Regexp Escape` keyword.\n\n= Multiline string comparison =\n\n`Should Be Equal` and `Should Be Equal As Strings` report the failures using\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_utility#Unified_format|unified diff\nformat] if both strings have more than two lines.\n\nExample:\n| ${first} =     `Catenate`    SEPARATOR=\\n    Not in second    Same    Differs    Same\n| ${second} =    `Catenate`    SEPARATOR=\\n    Same    Differs2    Same    Not in first\n| `Should Be Equal`    ${first}    ${second}\n\nResults in the following error message:\n\n| Multiline strings are different:\n| --- first\n| +++ second\n| @@ -1,4 +1,4 @@\n| -Not in second\n|  Same\n| -Differs\n| +Differs2\n|  Same\n| +Not in first",

Similarly as\n  with `Convert To Integer`, it is possible to use binary, octal, or\n  hex values by prefixing the values with ``0b``, ``0o``, or ``0x``,\n  respectively.\n\n- ``hex:`` Converts hexadecimal values to bytes. Single byte is always\n  two characters long (e.g. ``01`` or ``FF``). Spaces are ignored and\n  can be used freely as a visual separator.\n\n- ``bin:`` Converts binary values to bytes. Single byte is always eight\n  characters long (e.g. ``00001010``). Spaces are ignored and can be\n  used freely as a visual separator.\n\nIn addition to giving the input as a string, it is possible to use\nlists or other iterables containing individual characters or numbers.\nIn that case numbers do not need to be padded to certain length, and\nthey cannot contain extra spaces.\n\nExamples (last column shows returned bytes):\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | hyv\u00e4      |     | # hyv\\xe4      |\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | hyv\\xe4   |     | # hyv\\xe4      |\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | \\xff\\x07  |     | # \\xff\\x07     |\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | 82 70     | int | # RF           |\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | 0b10 0x10 | int | # \\x02\\x10     |\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | ff 00 07  | hex | # \\xff\\x00\\x07 |\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | 52462121  | hex | # RF!!         |\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | 0000 1000 | bin | # \\x08         |\n| ${input} = | Create List      | 1         | 2   | 12             |\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | ${input}  | int | # \\x01\\x02\\x0c |\n| ${bytes} = | Convert To Bytes | ${input}  | hex | # \\x01\\x02\\x12 |\n\nUse `Encode String To Bytes` in ``String`` library if you need to\nconvert text to bytes using a certain encoding.",

Negative precision means\nthat the number is rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power\nof the absolute precision. If a number is equally close to a certain\nprecision, it is rounded toward the even choice.\n\nIn addition to floating point values, all values accepted by `Convert\nTo Integer` can be used as well. The syntax is case-insensitive and\npossible spaces and underscores are ignored.\n\nExamples:\n| ${result} = | Convert To Number | 42.512 |    | # Result is 42.512 |\n| ${result} = | Convert To Number | 42.512 | 1  | # Result is 42.5   |\n| ${result} = | Convert To Number | 42.512 | 0  | # Result is 43.0   |\n| ${result} = | Convert To Number | 42.512 | -1 | # Result is 40.0   |\n| ${result} = | Convert To Number | 1E10   |    | # Result is 10000000000 |\n\nNotice that machines generally cannot store floating point numbers\naccurately.

Giving a true value to the ``no_decoration``\nargument allows getting variables without decoration.\n\nExample:\n| ${example_variable} =         | Set Variable | example value         |\n| ${variables} =                | Get Variables |                      |\n| Dictionary Should Contain Key | ${variables} | \\${example_variable} |\n| Dictionary Should Contain Key | ${variables} | \\${ExampleVariable}  |\n| Set To Dictionary             | ${variables} | \\${name} | value     |\n| Variable Should Not Exist     | \\${name}    |           |           |\n| ${no decoration} =            | Get Variables | no_decoration=Yes |\n| Dictionary Should Contain Key | ${no decoration} | example_variable |",

Non-string messages are converted to\nstrings automatically.\n\nMessages below the current active log\nlevel are ignored. See `Set Log Level` keyword and ``--loglevel``\ncommand line option for more details about setting the level.\n\nMessages logged with the WARN or ERROR levels are automatically\nvisible also in the console and in the Test Execution Errors section\nin the log file.\n\nIf the ``html`` argument is given a true value or the HTML pseudo log\nlevel is used, the message is considered to be HTML and special characters\nsuch as ``<`` are not escaped. For example, logging\n``<img src=\"image.png\">`` creates an image in this case, but\notherwise the message is that exact string. When using the HTML pseudo\nlevel, the messages is logged using the INFO level.\n\nThe ``console`` argument controls logging messages to the console in\naddition to the log file. Messages with the WARN and ERROR level are\nlogged to the console by default and others are not, but that can be\nchanged by setting ``console`` to ``True`` or ``False``. Another way\nto log messages to the console is using the CONSOLE pseudo level in\nwhich case the message is logged to the log file using the INFO level.\nIf the message should not be logged to the log file or there are special\nformatting needs, the `Log To Console` keyword can be used instead.\n\nThe ``formatter`` argument controls how to format the string\nrepresentation of the message. Possible values are ``str`` (default),\n``repr``, ``ascii``, ``len``, and ``type``. They work similarly to\nPython built-in functions with same names. When using ``repr``, bigger\nlists, dictionaries and other containers are also pretty-printed so\nthat there is one item per row. For more details see `String\nrepresentations`.\n\nThe old way to control string representation was using the ``repr``\nargument. This argument has been deprecated and ``formatter=repr``\nshould be used instead.\n\nExamples:\n| Log | Hello, world!        |          |   | # Normal INFO message.   |\n| Log | Warning, world!      | WARN     |   | # Warning.               |\n| Log | <b>Hello</b>, world! | html=yes |   | # INFO message as HTML.  |\n| Log | <b>Hello</b>, world! | HTML     |   | # Same as above.         |\n| Log | <b>Hello</b>, world! | DEBUG    | html=true | # DEBUG as HTML. |\n| Log | Hello, console!   | console=yes | | # Log also to the console. |\n| Log | Hello, console!   | CONSOLE     | | # Log also to the console. |\n| Log | Null is \\x00    | formatter=repr | | # Log ``'Null is \\x00'``. |\n\nSee `Log Many` if you want to log multiple messages in one go, and\n`Log To Console` if you only want to write to the console.\n\nFormatter options ``type`` and ``len`` are new in Robot Framework 5.0.\nThe CONSOLE level is new in Robot Framework 6.1.",

Variables are also\navailable in the evaluation namespace and can be accessed using special\n``$variable`` syntax as explained in the `Evaluating expressions` section.\n\nExample:\n| `Run Keyword If` | $result is None or $result == 'FAIL' | Keyword |\n\nThis keyword supports also optional ELSE and ELSE IF branches. Both\nof them are defined in ``*args`` and must use exactly format ``ELSE``\nor ``ELSE IF``, respectively. ELSE branches must contain first the\nname of the keyword to execute and then its possible arguments. ELSE\nIF branches must first contain a condition, like the first argument\nto this keyword, and then the keyword to execute and its possible\narguments. It is possible to have ELSE branch after ELSE IF and to\nhave multiple ELSE IF branches. Nested `Run Keyword If` usage is not\nsupported when using ELSE and/or ELSE IF branches.\n\nGiven previous example, if/else construct can also be created like this:\n| `Run Keyword If` | '${status}' == 'PASS' | Some Action | arg | ELSE | Another Action |\n\nThe return value of this keyword is the return value of the actually\nexecuted keyword or Python ``None`` if no keyword was executed (i.e.\nif ``condition`` was false). Hence, it is recommended to use ELSE\nand/or ELSE IF branches to conditionally assign return values from\nkeyword to variables (see `Set Variable If` you need to set fixed\nvalues conditionally). This is illustrated by the example below:\n\n| ${var1} =   | `Run Keyword If` | ${rc} == 0     | Some keyword returning a value |\n| ...         | ELSE IF          | 0 < ${rc} < 42 | Another keyword |\n| ...         | ELSE IF          | ${rc} < 0      | Another keyword with args | ${rc} | arg2 |\n| ...         | ELSE             | Final keyword to handle abnormal cases | ${rc} |\n| ${var2} =   | `Run Keyword If` | ${condition}  | Some keyword |\n\nIn this example, ${var2} will be set to ``None`` if ${condition} is\nfalse.\n\nNotice that ``ELSE`` and ``ELSE IF`` control words must be used\nexplicitly and thus cannot come from variables. If you need to use\nliteral ``ELSE`` and ``ELSE IF`` strings as arguments, you can escape\nthem with a backslash like ``\\ELSE`` and ``\\ELSE IF``.",

If the specified ``<option>`` is given a true value,\nthe variable is set also to the child suites. Parent and sibling suites\nwill never see variables set with this keyword.\n\nThe name of the variable can be given either as a normal variable name\nlike ``${NAME}`` or in escaped format as ``\\${NAME}`` or ``$NAME``.\nFor the reasons explained in the `Using variables with keywords creating\nor accessing variables` section, *using the escaped format is highly\nrecommended*.\n\nVariable value can be specified using the same syntax as when variables\nare created in the Variables section. Same way as in that section,\nit is possible to create scalar values, lists and dictionaries.\nThe type is got from the variable name prefix ``$``, ``@`` and ``&``,\nrespectively.\n\nIf a variable already exists within the new scope, its value will be\noverwritten.

How long to retry running the keyword is\ndefined using ``retry`` argument either as timeout or count.\n``retry_interval`` is the time to wait between execution attempts.\n\nIf ``retry`` is given as timeout, it must be in Robot Framework's\ntime format (e.g. ``1 minute``, ``2 min 3 s``, ``4.5``) or given as\na ``timedelta`` object. If ``retry`` is\ngiven as count, it must have ``times`` or ``x`` postfix (e.g.\n``5 times``, ``10 x``). ``retry_interval`` must always be given in\nRobot Framework's time format or as a ``timedelta``.\n\nBy default, ``retry_interval`` is the time to wait _after_ a keyword has\nfailed. For example, if the first run takes 2 seconds and the retry\ninterval is 3 seconds, the second run starts 5 seconds after the first\nrun started. If ``retry_interval`` start with prefix ``strict:``, the\nexecution time of the previous keyword is subtracted from the retry time.\nWith the earlier example the second run would thus start 3 seconds after\nthe first run started. A warning is logged if keyword execution time is\nlonger than a strict interval.\n\nIf the keyword does not succeed regardless of retries, this keyword\nfails.

Errors caused by\ninvalid syntax, test or keyword timeouts, or fatal exceptions (caused\ne.g. by `Fatal Error`) are not caught.\n\nRunning the same keyword multiple times inside this keyword can create\nlots of output and considerably increase the size of the generated\noutput files.

This\nmeans that the value used in the expression will be the string\nrepresentation of the variable value, not the variable value itself.\nThis is not a problem with numbers and other objects that have a string\nrepresentation that can be evaluated directly, but with other objects\nthe behavior depends on the string representation. Most importantly,\nstrings must always be quoted, and if they can contain newlines, they must\nbe triple quoted.\n\nExamples:\n| `Should Be True`    ${rc} < 10                   Return code greater than 10\n| `Run Keyword If`    '${status}' == 'PASS'        `Log`    Passed\n| `Run Keyword If`    'FAIL' in '''${output}'''    `Log`    Output contains FAIL\n\nActual variables values are also available in the evaluation namespace.\nThey can be accessed using special variable syntax without the curly\nbraces like ``$variable``. These variables should never be quoted.\n\nExamples:\n| `Should Be True`    $rc < 10             Return code greater than 10\n| `Run Keyword If`    $status == 'PASS'    `Log`    Passed\n| `Run Keyword If`    'FAIL' in $output    `Log`    Output contains FAIL\n| `Should Be True`    len($result) > 1 and $result[1] == 'OK'\n| `Should Be True`    $result is not None",
