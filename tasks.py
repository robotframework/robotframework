`Robot Framework`_ {version} is a new release with **UPDATE** enhancements
and bug fixes. **MORE intro stuff...**

**REMOVE reference to tracker if release notes contain all issues.**
All issues targeted for Robot Framework {version.milestone} can be found
from the `issue tracker milestone`_.

Questions and comments related to the release can be sent to the
`robotframework-users`_ mailing list or to `Robot Framework Slack`_,
and possible bugs submitted to the `issue tracker`_.

**REMOVE ``--pre`` from the next command with final releases.**
If you have pip_ installed, just run

::

   pip install --pre --upgrade robotframework

to install the latest available release or use

::

   pip install robotframework=={version}

to install exactly this version. Alternatively you can download the source
distribution from PyPI_ and install it manually. For more details and other
installation approaches, see the `installation instructions`_.

    Following PEP-440 compatible version numbers are supported:
    - Final version like 3.0 or 3.1.2.
    - Alpha, beta or release candidate with `a`, `b` or `rc` postfix,
      respectively, and an incremented number like 3.0a1 or 3.0.1rc1.
    - Development version with `.dev` postix and an incremented number like
      3.0.dev1 or 3.1a1.dev2.

    When the given version is `dev`, the existing version number is updated
    to the next suitable development version. For example, 3.0 -> 3.0.1.dev1,
